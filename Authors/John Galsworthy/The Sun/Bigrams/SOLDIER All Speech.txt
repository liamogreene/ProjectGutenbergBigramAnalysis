 Daisy! Daisy! Hallo, old pretty girl! [GIRL does not move, barring the way, as it were.] 
 What sort o' things, this lovely day? Why, I got things that'd take me years to tell. Have you missed me, Daisy? 
 So I 'ave. My Gawd! It's a way they 'ave in the Army. I said when I got out of it I'd laugh. Like as the sun itself I used to think of you, Daisy, when the trumps was comin' over, and the wind was up. D'you remember that last night in the wood? "Come back and marry me quick, Jack." Well, here I am--got me pass to heaven. No more fightin', no more drillin', no more sleepin' rough. We can get married now, Daisy. We can live soft an' 'appy. Give us a kiss, my dear. 
 [Blankly] Why not? [MAN, with a swift movement steps along the hedge to THE  GIRL'S side.] 
 [Leaping over the stile] 'Oo are you, Pompey? The sun don't shine in your inside, do it? 'Oo is he, Daisy? 
 Your-man! Lummy! "Taffy was a Welshman, Taffy was a thief!" Well, mate! So you've been through it, too. I'm laughin' this mornin' as luck will 'ave it. Ah! I can see your knife. 
 Not at you, not at you. [He looks from one to the other] I'm laughin' at things in general. Where did you get it, mate? 
 Think o' that! An' I never was touched. Four years an' never was touched. An' so you've come an' took my girl! Nothin' doin'! Ha! [Again he looks from one to the other-then away] Well! The world's before me! [He laughs] I'll give you Daisy for a lung protector. 
 That's all right, then. You keep 'er. I've got a laugh in me you can't put out, black as you look! Good-bye, little Daisy! [GIRL makes a movement towards him.] 
 Look 'ere, mate; shake 'ands! I don't want to see a girl cry, this day of all, with the sun shinin'. I seen too much of sorrer. You and me've been at the back of it. We've 'ad our whack. Shake! 
 [After a long moment's pause] Oh! I thought I did. 
 [Slowly] Mate, you done your bit, an' I done mine. It's took us two ways, seemin'ly. 
 Daisy, which of us will you 'ave? 
 You see, mate! Put your 'ands down. There's nothin' for it but a laugh. You an' me know that. Laugh, mate! 
 It's no use, mate. I can't do it. I said I'd laugh to-day, and laugh I will. I've come through that, an' all the stink of it; I've come through sorrer. Never again! Cheerio, mate! The sun's a-shinin'! He turns away. 
 [Looking back] No fear, my dear! Enjoy your fancy! So long! Gawd bless you both! He sings, and goes along the path, and the song fades away. "I'll be right there to-night  Where the fields are snowy white;  Banjos ringing, darkies singing  All the world seems bright!"
