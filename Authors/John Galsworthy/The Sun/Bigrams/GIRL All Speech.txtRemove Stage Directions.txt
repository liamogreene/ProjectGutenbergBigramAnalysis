 God knows what 'e'll say, Jim. He couldn't come before. I'm frightened. 'E was fond o' me. I ought to 'a waited, Jim; with 'im in the fightin'. 
 Ah! Not like you, Jim--not like you. I promised him. I ought to 'a waited. I never thought he'd come back from the fightin'. 
 What'll he be like, I wonder? I never could. I'd rather have it off me mind, with him home. What's the time, Jim? 
 He said four o'clock. Jim, you better go. 
 I dunno, just. I've not seen him these three years. I dunno no more, since I've known you. 'Bout your size. Oh! Jim, go along! Jim, do you love me true? 
 I ain't ashamed--I ain't ashamed. If 'e could see me 'eart. Jim, don't lift your hand to 'im! Promise! Promise! 
 Nor p'raps he isn't. God 'elp us! P'raps he'll say that too. I'm frightened: 
 Oh, no! Give it to me, Jim! 
 Jim, you won't go fightin' in the sun, with the birds all callin'? And I love you, Jim. I don't want nothin' more than you in all the world. It's him! Hallo, Jack! 
 I got things to tell you! You been so long. 
 No. My man. 
 Jim! 
 Oh! Him! Jack, don't think too 'ard of me!
