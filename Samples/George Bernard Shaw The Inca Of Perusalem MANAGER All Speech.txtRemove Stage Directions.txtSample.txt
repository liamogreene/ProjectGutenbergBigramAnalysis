a room in the annexe -- The rooms are quite as good up here. There is less noise; and there is the lift. If Your Highness desires anything, there is the telephone -- Can I take any order? Some tea? Pardon, Your Highness; but I have received an urgent inquiry for rooms from an English family of importance; and I venture to ask you to let me know how long you intend to honor us with your presence. Twenty minutes! I do not understand. But I have explained. The first floor is occupied. At least -- It is occupied. But Her Highness was so gracious. I did not know that Her Highness was at all particular. Can Your Highness believe this of me? Have I had the misfortune to offend Your Highness? Oh please, mademoiselle. Believe me: our only wish is to make you perfectly comfortable. But in consequence of the war, all royal personages now practise a rigid economy, and desire us to treat them like their poorest subjects. There are basins with hot and cold taps. You are hard to please, mademoiselle.
