 He did not, Mr. Hazel. Ah, he won't be long coming. It's seldom he does be late. 
 It is, sir. Boiled beef and parsnips, the same as every Monday for all comers, and an apple pie for yourself and Mr. Mineog.
 I will, sir. _(He drops coats in putting them up. Then notices broken pane in window and picks up the coats hurriedly, putting them on wrong pegs. Hazel and Mineog have sat down.)_ 
 I'll go in search of something to stop it, sir. This bit of a board I brought is too unshapely.
 I will, sir. 
(Coming in, puts pie on table.)_ Wait now, sir, till I'll aid you to handle Mr. Hazel's coat. _(Whips off coat, takes up other coat, hangs both on pegs.)_ The apple pie, Sir. _(Hazel sits down, gasping and wiping his face. Mineog turns his back.)_
 Is there anything after happening, Mr. Hazel? 
 Ah, what signifies? There to be more of battles in the world there would be less of wars. _(He pushes Mineog's chair to table.)_ 
 Are these belonging to you, Mr. Mineog?
