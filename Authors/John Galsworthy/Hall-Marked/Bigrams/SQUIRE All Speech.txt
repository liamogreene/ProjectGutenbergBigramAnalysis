and RECTOR, come hastening along  the verandah.] 
and RECTOR Come in. 
and RECTOR make an involuntary  movement of approach.] 
 Done him good, little beast! 
 Well, I would--only she - 
 By Jove! No. It was topping. 
 Ah! Yes. Who is she? Pretty woman! 
 All right! [Exerting himself] Here's a bell! 
re-enter.] Have you tied him properly this time? 
 All right, Ella; all right! He doesn't mean what you mean! 
 [Taking EDWARD by the collar, and holding his own nose] Jove! Clever if he can smell anything but himself. Phew! She ought to have the Victoria Cross for goin' in that pond. [The door opens, and HERSELF appears; a fine, frank, handsome  woman, in a man's orange-coloured motor-coat, hastily thrown on  over the substrata of costume.] 
 [Restraining EDWARD] Little beast will fight--must apologise--you were too quick for me - [He looks up at her. She is smiling, and regarding the wounded  dog, her head benevolently on one side.] 
 All right. Am I to let him go? 
 She's all there. 
 [Suddenly] Eh? 
 [Looking at his wife] Ah! 
 [Bluntly] Ella, the Rector wants to get up! 
 [Meditating] So she's married! 
 Braces. 
 Ah! Yes. Wonder who they are? [RECTOR and MAUD reappear.] 
 Dogs take to her. That's a sure sign. 
 Something very attractive about her--what! Fine build of woman. 
 Wonder if her husband shoots? She seems quite-er--quite - 
 I say--who is she? 
 H'm! I suppose we ought to be a bit careful. [JARVIS, flyman of the old school, has appeared on the  verandah.] 
 Challenger? Sounds like a hound. What's he like? 
 H'm! Ah! 
 [Drawing a little closer] Three weeks? I say--er -- wasn't there a book? 
 Must think of the village. Didn't quite like the doctor's way of puttin' us off. 
 H'm! Dash it! Yes! Can't forget the way she ran into that stinkin' pond. 
 It'd be dashed awkward--mustn't take a false step, Ella. 
 That's all right, Rector--we're goin' to be perfectly polite, and--and--thank her, and all that. 
 I'll ring the bell. [He rings.] [They look at each other aghast.] 
 [Flabbergasted] God knows! 
 Rector--you--you've got to - 
 [Deeply-to himself] The whole thing's damn delicate. [The door right is opened and a MAID appears. She is a  determined-looking female. They face her in silence.] 
 [To him in a low, determined voice] Go on. 
 Phew! What a gorgon! I say, Rector, did you really know a Challenger in the 'nineties? 
 Ha! Jolly good! 
 Hold on! You goin' to ask 'em to--to--anything? 
 As they are? H'm! How can you till you know? 
 And supposing she'd turned out not married--eh! LADYELLA! She'd still be herself, wouldn't she? 
 H'm! Don't know about that. 
 We're really most tremendously obliged to you. Afraid we've been an awful nuisance. 
 Hope to make the acquaintance of Mr -of your husband.

 I don't know if your husband shoots, but if - [MAUD, catching his eye, taps the third finger of her left  hand.] --er--he--does--er--er - [HERSELF looks at

 [Abruptly--of the unoffending EDWARD] That dog'll be forgettin' himself in a minute. [He picks up EDWARD and takes him out.] [
