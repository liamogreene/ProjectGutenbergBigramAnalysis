 Don't bring Hannibal in till I know where she's put Edward! 
 Maud, do take him out! Tie him up. Here! [She takes out a lace handkerchief ] No--something stronger! Poor darling Edward! [To HANNIBAL] You are a bad dog! [HANNIBAL snuffles.] 
 Tie him up outside. Here, take my scarf. Where is my poor treasure? [She removes her scarf] Catch! His ear's torn; I saw it. 
 Tie him up, Maud. I must try in here. [Their husbands, 
is knocking on the door  left.] 
 May I come in? 
recoils. 
 Oh! There you are! 
 Hannibal would have killed him, if she hadn't rushed in! 
 Why didn't you go in, Tommy? 
 I can't think how she got Edward out of Hannibal's awful mouth! 
 We must simply thank her tremendously! I shall never forget the way she ran in, with her skirts up to her waist! 
 Her clothes must be ruined. That pond--ugh! [She wrinkles her nose] Tommy, do have it drained. 
 I must get the Vet. to Edward. [To SQUIRE] Tommy, do exert yourself! [MAUD re-enters.] 
 Oh, please! Poor darling! [They listen.] [LADYELLA, prepares to receive EDWARD SQUIRE and RECTOR  stand transfixed. The door opens, and a bare arm gently pushes  EDWARD forth. He is bandaged with a smooth towel. There is a  snuffle--HANNIBAL has broken the scarf, outside.] 
 [Aghast] Look! Hannibal's loose! Maud--Tommy. [To THE RECTOR] You! [The THREE rush to prevent HANNIBAL from re-entering.] 
 [To EDWARD] Yes, I know--you'd like to! You SHALL bite him when it's safe. Oh! my darling, you DO -[She sniffs] [MAUD and 
 Oh! but - 
 Rector, are you sure it's safe? 
 Tommy, do lend a hand! 
 [Transferring EDWARD to SQUIRE] Hold him, Tommy. He's sure to smell out Hannibal! 
 We're so awfully grateful to you. It was splendid. 
 Is he very badly torn? 
 I thought so. Tommy, do - 
 No. 
 Look! Catch him! Rector! 
 Splendid, isn't she? I do admire her. 
 A silence.  MAUD reappears at the door and stands gazing at the braces.] 
 [Absorbed in EDWARD] Poor darling! 
 Oh! [She turns to the wall.] [RECTOR, screened by his WIFE, retires on to the verandah to  adjust his garments.] 
 [Absorbed in EDWARD] Why? 
 Oh! Yes. We ought to ask them to dinner, Tommy. 
 Oh! Thank goodness! 
 Oh! I! 
 I dreaded it. She is splendid! 
 [Watching the door] Quite! Altogether charming; one of the nicest faces I ever saw. [THE DOCTOR comes out alone.] Oh! Doctor--have you? is it -? 
 Poor darling! Can I - [She signs toward the door.] 
 Oh, Jarvis--what's the name of the people here? 
 [Suddenly] Er--thank you, Jarvis; you needn't wait. 
 [Impulsively] Oh, bother! I'm sure she's all right. And if she isn't, I don't care. She's been much too splendid. 
 The poor darling owes his life to her. 
 Well, I'm not going to be ungrateful. 
 We can see she's a good sort. What does it matter? 
 What did you ring for, Tommy? 
 Our dog has been fighting with the Rector's, and Mrs Challenger rescued him; she's bathing his ear. We're waiting to thank her. You needn't - 
 Well, you see!--it's all right. 
 [Moving to the door] I must go in now. 
 Yes. 
 Why not? We all like the look of her. 
 Yes. It's horrible not having the courage to take people as they are. 
 Trust our instincts, of course. 
 Of course she would, Tommy. 
 There's the poor darling snuffling. I must go in. [She knocks on the door. It is opened, and EDWARD comes out  briskly, with a neat little white pointed ear-cap on one ear.] 
 Precious! [SHE HERSELF Comes out, now properly dressed in flax-blue  linen.] 
 How perfectly sweet of you to make him that! 
 [To EDWARD, who is straining] [Gently, darling! Tommy, take him.] [
 [Producing a card] I can't be too grateful for all you've done for my poor darling. This is where we live. Do come -- and see - [MAUD, whose eyes have never left those hands, tweaks LADY  ELLA's dress.] 
 That is--I'm--I - [HERSELF looks at 
in surprise.] 
is left staring.] 
 [At last] You mustn't think, I -You mustn't think, we -Oh! I must just see they--don't let Edward get at Hannibal. [She skims away.] [HERSELF is left staring after LADYELLA, in surprise.]
