 
 Oh! it's you, Larry! Why did you knock? I was so frightened. Come in! 
 
 Oh! Who is it? 
 Who are you, please? 
 Yes? Yes; oh, yes! Awful--it is awful! Just where you are standing. I see him now, always falling. Wanda. I would die for him! 
 
 If I can save him! Won't you sit down? Eighteen month. No. I came here to live a bad life. Nobody know me. I am quite alone. No; I have not dared to go out. KEITH: Well, they have; and they'll look for anyone connected with him, of course. He never let people think I was married to him. I don't know if I was--really. We went to an office and signed our names; but he was a wicked man. He treated many, I think, like me. Never! And that man first went for him. No. A woman come at nine in the morning for an hour. No. He is always gone. No; I am verree quiet. Since I know your brother, I see no one, sare. Oh, yes! I love him. Nobody come here but him for a long time now. Five month. 
 Crying. 
 He is in danger because of me. I am so afraid for him. 
 Look! I have burned all the things he have given me--even his picture. Now I have nothing from him. Yes. Please do not take him from me altogether. I will be so careful. I will not do anything to hurt him. But if I cannot see him sometimes, I shall die. Please do not take him from me. 
 
 But you will be kind? Suddenly she bends and kisses his hand. KEITH draws his hand away, and she recoils a little humbly, looking up at him again. Suddenly she stands rigid, listening. 
 Listen! Someone--out there! She darts past him and turns out the light. There is a knock on the door. They are now close together between door and window. 
 Oh! Who is it? Yes, and you have his keys. Oh! if it is Larry! I must open! KEITH shrinks back against the wall. WANDA goes to the door. 
 Yes? Please? Who? A thin streak of light from a bull's-eye lantern outside plays over the wall. A Policeman's voice says: "All right, Miss. Your outer door's open. You ought to keep it shut after dark, you know." Thank you, air. 
 A policeman! 
 I did not think they did, sir. It is so long I was not out in the town; not since I had Larry. KEITH gives her an intent look, then crosses to the fire. He stands there a moment, looking down, then turns to the girl, who has crept back to the couch. 
 Oh, sir! May I not love, because I have been bad? I was only sixteen when that man spoiled me. If you knew - 
 Oh, sir! Look! It is true. He is my life. Don't take him away from me. 
 He will, sir. No, no, you do not. It is I who know him. 
 But he love me. Oh, sir! he love me! Yes, but -
. 
 It will be in the water, then. There will be no cruel men there. 
 I will go if Larry say I must. But not to live. No! 
 I could not, sir. 
 I could not live without Larry. What is left for a girl like me -- when she once love? It is finish. No; you do not care what I do. Why should you? I tell you I will go if Larry say I must. 
 Yes! Oh, yes! But do not keep him long from me--I beg! 
 
 Larry! Oh, thank God! 
 
 
 Larry! Oh, Larry! Oh, Larry! But so are you. What did we want--to kill that man? Never! Oh! kiss me! 
 I have suffered so--not seein' you. Don't leave me again--don't! Stay here. Isn't it good to be together?--Oh! Poor Larry! How tired you look!--Stay with me. I am so frightened all alone. So frightened they will take you from me. No, no! Don't look like that! I will make up the fire. Love me, Larry! I want to forget. No, no! I can't bear it! Don't frighten me more! 
 
 If we could sleep a little--wouldn't it be nice? 
 Promise to stay with me--to stay here for good, Larry. I will cook for you; I will make you so comfortable. They will find him innocent. And then--Oh, Larry! in the sun-right away--far from this horrible country. How lovely! 
 Larry! No, no! No, no! You don't want me to die, Larry, do you? I shall if you leave me. Let us be happy! Love me! 
 No, no! See! I will pray to the Virgin. She will pity us! She falls on her knees and clasps her hands, praying. Her lips move. LARRY stands motionless, with arms crossed, and on his face are yearning and mockery, love and despair. She is smiling! We shall be happy soon. 
 Yes! oh, yes! If you die I could not--I could not go on living! CURTAIN SCENE III. TWO MONTHS LATER WANDA'S room. Daylight is just beginning to fail of a January afternoon. The table is laid for supper, with decanters of wine. WANDA is standing at the window looking out at the wintry trees of the Square beyond the pavement. A newspaper Boy's voice is heard coming nearer. VOICE. Pyper! Glove Lyne murder! Trial and verdict! 
 Verdict! Pyper! WANDA throws up the window as if to call to him, checks herself, closes it and runs to the door. She opens it, but recoils into the room. KEITH is standing there. He comes in. He went to the trial. I could not keep him from it. The trial--Oh! what has happened, sir? Of death! 
 Yes. Will you sit down, please? Yes, yes; always I am ready. Yes--but now! What will he do? That poor man! Perhaps he was hungry. I have been hungry: you do things then that you would not. Larry has thought of him in prison so much all these weeks. Oh! what shall we do now? Yes. But why has he not come in? Oh! If he have, already! 
 I will try, sir. 
 Larry! 
 
 What does it mean? 
 Oh, Larry! Larry! Promise me--wherever you go, I go too. Promise! Larry, you think I haven't seen, all these weeks. But I have seen everything; all in your heart, always. You cannot hide from me. I knew--I knew! Oh, if we might go away into the sun! Oh! Larry--couldn't we? 
 Well! If it must be dark--I don't care, if I may go in your arms. In prison we could not be together. I am ready. Only love me first. Don't let me cry before I go. Oh! Larry, will there be much pain? 
 It is a pity. 
 Oh, Larry!
