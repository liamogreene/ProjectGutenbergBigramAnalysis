 How do, Lady Ella? How do, Squire?--how do, Rector? [To MAUD] How de do? This the beastie? I see. Quite! Who'll hold him for me? 
 Right as rain! She held him like an angel--he just licked her, and never made a sound. 
 Better leave 'em a minute. She's moppin' 'im off. [He wrinkles his nose] Wonderful clever hands! 
 [Looking from face to face with a dubious and rather quizzical expression] Who? Well--there you have me! All I know is she's a first-rate nurse--been helpin' me with a case in Ditch Lane. Nice woman, too--thorough good sort! Quite an acquisition here. H'm! [Again that quizzical glance] Excuse me hurryin' off--very late. Good-bye, Rector. Good-bye, Lady Ella. Good-bye! [He goes. A silence.]
