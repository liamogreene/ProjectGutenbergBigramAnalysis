 Who's there? 
 Come in! I was asleep. 
 The sound of LARRY's breathing can be heard. 
 Well, Larry, what is it? LARRY comes skirting along the wall, as if craving its support, outside the radius of the light. 
 Are you ill? LARRY stands still again and heaves a deep sigh. 
 What is it, man? 
 Have you committed a murder that you stand there like a fish? 
 By Jove! Drunk again! 
 What do you mean by coming here in this state? I told you - If you weren't my brother -! Come here, where I can we you! What's the matter with you, Larry? 
 
 What in God's name is this nonsense? 
 Come, Larry! Pull yourself together and drop exaggeration! What on earth do you mean? 
 Be quiet! LARRY lifts his hands and wrings them. 
 Why come here and tell me this? When--when--what -? Good God! How? Where? You'd better tell me quietly from the beginning. Here, drink this coffee; it'll clear your head. He pours out and hands him a cup of coffee. LARRY drinks it off. Women! Always women, with you! Well? Yes? 
 What did you do then? Well? How far? Was--did anyone see? What time? And then? Why--in heaven's name? Where is this place? And the archway? Good God! Why, I saw it in the paper this morning. They were talking of it in the Courts! 
 Here it is again. "Body of a man was found this morning under an archway in Glove Lane. From marks about the throat grave suspicion of foul play are entertained. The body had apparently been robbed." My God! 
 You saw this in the paper and dreamed it. D'you understand, Larry?--you dreamed it. Did you take anything from the-body? 
 "Patrick Walenn"--Was that his name? "Simon's Hotel, Farrier Street, London." 
 No!--that makes me -
 What in God's name made you come here and tell me? Don't you know I'm--I'm within an ace of a Judgeship? Love! Steady, Larry! Let's think it out. You weren't seen, you say? When did you leave the girl again? Where did you go? To Fitzroy Street? What have you done since? Not been out? Not seen the girl? 
 Will she give you away? Or herself hysteria? Who knows of your relations with her? No one? Did anyone see you go in last night, when you first went to her? Give them to me. LARRY takes two keys from his pocket and hands them to his brother. What! A girl like that? 
 What else have you that connects you with her? In your rooms? 
 Photographs? Letters? Sure? No one saw you going back to her? 
 Nor leave in the morning? You can't be certain. You were fortunate. Sit down again, man. I must think. He turns to the fire and leans his elbows on the mantelpiece and his head on his hands. LARRY Sits down again obediently. It's all too unlikely. It's monstrous! This Walenn--was it his first reappearance after an absence? How did he find out where she was? 
 How drunk were you? How much had you drunk, then? You say you didn't mean to kill him. That's something. She was hanging on to him, you say?--That's ugly. D'you mean she--loves you? 
 Can a woman like that love? 
 I'm trying to get at truth. If you want me to help, I must know everything. What makes you think she's fond of you? I'm talking of love. 
 What made you choose that archway? Did his face look as if he'd been strangled? Did it? 
 Very disfigured? Did you look to see if his clothes were marked? Why not? 
 You say he was disfigured. Would he be recognisable? When she lived with him last--where was that? Not Soho? 
 How long has she been at this Soho place? Living this life? Till, she met you? And you believe -? 
 Always in the same rooms? What was he? A professional bully? 
 Spending most of his time abroad, I suppose. Can you say if he was known to the police? Now listen, Larry. When you leave here, go straight home, and stay there till I give you leave to go out again. Promise. Is your promise worth anything? Exactly. But if I'm to help you, you must do as I say. I must have time to think this out. Have you got money? 
 Half-quarter day--yes, your quarter's always spent by then. If you're to get away--never mind, I can manage the money. 
 Privilege of A brother. As it happens, I'm thinking of myself and our family. You can't indulge yourself in killing without bringing ruin. My God! I suppose you realise that you've made me an accessory after the fact--me, King's counsel--sworn to the service of the Law, who, in a year or two, will have the trying of cases like yours! By heaven, Larry, you've surpassed yourself! Come, Larry! Hand it over. Come, Larry! Courage! LARRY looks up at him. Don't go out. Don't drink. Don't talk. Pull yourself together! No, no. Courage! LARRY reaches the door, turns as if to say something-finds no words, and goes. 
 Courage! My God! I shall need it! CURTAIN SCENE II At out eleven o'clock the following night an WANDA'S room on the ground floor in Soho. In the light from one close-shaded electric bulb the room is but dimly visible. A dying fire burns on the left. A curtained window in the centre of the back wall. A door on the right. The furniture is plush-covered and commonplace, with a kind of shabby smartness. A couch, without back or arms, stands aslant, between window and fire. 
 
 
 A friend of Larry's. Don't be frightened. She has recoiled again to the window; and when he finds the switch and turns the light up, she is seen standing there holding her dark wrapper up to her throat, so that her face has an uncanny look of being detached from the body. 
 You needn't be afraid. I haven't come to do you harm -- quite the contrary. 
 Larry wouldn't have given me these, would he, if he hadn't trusted me? WANDA does not move, staring like a spirit startled out of the flesh. 
 I'm sorry to have startled you. Larry's brother. WANDA, with a sigh of utter relief, steals forward to the couch and sinks down. KEITH goes up to her. He'd told me. An awful business! 
 In this room? 
 You--look very young. What's your name? Are you fond of Larry? I--I've come to see what you can do to save him. WANDA, 
 You would not deceive me. You are really his brother? I swear it. 
 This, man, your--your husband, before he came here the night before last--how long since you saw him? Does anyone about here know you are his wife? They've discovered who he was--you know that? Did my brother ever see him before? Yes. I saw the mark. Have you a servant? Does she know Larry? Friends--acquaintances? 
 Do you mean that? How long? So you have not been out since -? 
 What have you been doing? 
 Look at me. 
 If the worst comes, and this man is traced to you, can you trust yourself not to give Larry away? 
 Good! One more question. Do the police know you--because--of your life? 
 You know where Larry lives? You mustn't go there, and he mustn't come to you. 
 Leave that to me. I'm going to do all I can. 
 You said no one comes but Larry. 
 Curse! I must have left that door. 
 You told me they didn't know you. 
 After your life, who can believe ? Look here! You drifted together and you'll drift apart, you know. Better for him to get away and make a clean cut of it. I'm thinking of Larry. With you, his danger is much greater. There's a good chance as things are going. You may wreck it. And for what? Just a few months more of--well--you know. 
 You must know what Larry is. He'll never stick to you. 
 The last man on earth to stick to anything! But for the sake of a whim he'll risk his life and the honour of all his family. I know him. Now, now! At any moment they may find out your connection with that man. So long as Larry goes on with you, he's tied to this murder, don't you see? Larry has loved dozens of women. 
 Don't cry! If I give you money, will you disappear, for his sake? Ah! First Larry, then you! Come now. It's better for you both. A few months, and you'll forget you ever met. I don't want you to go back to that life. That's not enough. You know that. You must take it out of his hands. He will never give up his present for the sake of his future. If you're as fond of him as you say, you'll help to save him. Well, well! Get up. 
 Listen! 
 
 So much for your promise not to go out! Exactly! So you can joke, can you? A boat leaves for the Argentine the day after to-morrow; you must go by it. You can't go together. I'll send her by the next boat. Yes. You're lucky they're on a false scent. You haven't seen it? They've taken up a vagabond who robbed the body. He pawned a snake-shaped ring, and they identified this Walenn by it. I've been down and seen him charged myself. He's in no danger. They always get the wrong man first. It'll do him no harm to be locked up a bit--hyena like that. Better in prison, anyway, than sleeping out under archways in this weather. A little yellow, ragged, lame, unshaven scarecrow of a chap. They were fools to think he could have had the strength. You? Where? You went back there? He's in no danger, I tell you. He could never have strangled -Why, he hadn't the strength of a kitten. Now, Larry! I'll take your berth to-morrow. Here's money 
 You can make a new life of it out there together presently, in the sun. Bosh! Dismiss it from your mind; there's not nearly enough evidence. No. You've got your chance. Take it like a man. What! I tell you no jury would convict; and if they did, no judge would hang. A ghoul who can rob a dead body, ought to be in prison. He did worse than you. Don't be a fool! 
 I suppose I may ask you not to be entirely oblivious of our name. Or is that unworthy of your honour? 
 You owe it to me--to our name--to our dead mother --to do nothing anyway till we see what happens. 
 Can I trust you? 
 Swear? Remember, nothing! Good night! Where's Larry? 
 Guilty! Sentence of death! Fools!--idiots! Girl! girl! It may all depend on you. Larry's still living here? I must wait for him. 
 Are you ready to go away at any time? And he? A graveyard thief--a ghoul! Listen! Help me. Don't let Larry out of your sight. I must see how things go. They'll never hang this wretch. 
 Now, we must stop Larry from giving himself up. He's fool enough. D'you understand? 
 My God! If the police come--find me here--
 No, he wouldn't without seeing you first. He's sure to come. Watch him like a lynx. Don't let him go without you. Listen! 
 It's he! LARRY enters. He is holding a great bunch of pink lilies and white narcissus. His face tells nothing. KEITH looks from him to the girl, who stands motionless. The thing can't stand. I'll stop it somehow. But you must give me time, Larry. 
 Think my reasons what you like. This man can and shall get off. I want your solemn promise that you won't give yourself up, nor even go out till I've seen you again. 
 By the memory of our mother, swear that. I have your oath--both of you--both of you. I'm going at once to see what can be done.
