 [To RECTOR] Beg pardon, sir. Is the little dog all right? 
 [Touching his hat] Seein' you've missed your train, m'm, shall I wait, and take you 'ome again? 
 Cert'nly, m'm. [He touches his hat with a circular gesture, and is about to withdraw.] 
 Challenger's the name I've driven 'em in, my lady. 
 [Scratching his head] Wears a soft 'at, sir. 
 Very nice gentleman, very nice lady. 'Elped me with my old mare when she 'ad the 'ighsteria last week--couldn't 'a' been kinder if they'd 'a' been angels from 'eaven. Wonderful fond o' dumb animals, the two of 'em. I don't pay no attention to gossip, meself. 
 [Backing] Did I make use of the word, m'm? You'll excuse me, I'm sure. There's always talk where there's newcomers. I takes people as I finds 'em. 
 Yes, sir. I've--I've got a 'abit that way at my time o' life. 
 Well er--a matter of three weeks, m'm. [A slight involuntary stir.] [Apologetic] Of course, in my profession I can't afford to take notice of whether there's the trifle of a ring between 'em, as the sayin' is. 'Tisn't 'ardly my business like. [A silence.] 
 No, m'lady. Your service, sir--service, m'm. [He goes. A silence.]
