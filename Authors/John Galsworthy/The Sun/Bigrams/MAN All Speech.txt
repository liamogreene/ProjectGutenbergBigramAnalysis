 Let 'im. 'E's come too late, that's all. 
 And aren't I fond of you? 
 [Passionately] And what about me? Aren't I been in the fightin'--earned all I could get? 
 Did you--? [He cannot speak the words.] 
 Have a spirit, then. 
 One man's luck's another's poison. 
 [Grimly] Maybe 'e'd better not 'ave. 
 [Gripping her shoulder] Daisy, don't you never go back on me, or I should kill you, and 'im too. [GIRL looks at him, shivers, and puts her lips to his.] 
 Will you run for it? 'E'd never find us! [GIRL shakes her head.] MAN [Dully] What's the good o' stayin'? The world's wide. 
 [Clenching his hands] It's temptin' Providence. 
 [Glancing at the sun] 'Alf past four. 
 Not I. I've not got the wind up. I've seen as much of hell as he has, any day. What like is he? 
 Big or little chap? 
 No fear! What's a blighter like that to old Fritz's shells? We didn't shift when they was comin'. If you'll go, I'll go; not else. [Again she shakes her head.] 
 Daisy! If I'd known you out there, I never could 'a stuck it. They'd 'a got me for a deserter. That's how I love you! 
 That's according. 
 If 'e keeps quiet, I won't. But I'm not accountable--not always, I tell you straight--not since I've been through that. 
 Like as not. It takes the lynch pins out, I tell you. 
 [Grimly] Ah! We said that a bit too often. What we want we take, now; there's no one else to give it us, and there's no fear'll stop us; we seen the bottom of things. 
 Then it'll be 'im or me. 
 [Tenderly] No, Daisy, no! The river's handy. One more or less. 'E shan't 'arm you; nor me neither. [He takes out a knife.] 
 [Smiling] No fear! [He puts it away] Shan't 'ave no need for it like as not. All right, little Daisy; you can't be expected to see things like what we do. What's life, anyway? I've seen a thousand lives taken in five minutes. I've seen dead men on the wires like flies on a flypaper. I've been as good as dead meself a hundred times. I've killed a dozen men. It's nothin'. He's safe, if 'e don't get my blood up. If he does, nobody's safe; not 'im, nor anybody else; not even you. I'm speakin' sober. 
 That depends on 'im. I'm not lookin' for it. Daisy, I love you. I love your hair. I love your eyes. I love you. 
 Amen to that, my dear. Kiss me close! The sound of a voice singing breaks in on their embrace. THE  GIRL starts from his arms, and looks behind her along the  towing-path. MAN draws back against, the hedge, fingering  his side, where the knife is hidden. The song comes nearer. "I'll be right there to-night, Where the fields are snowy white; Banjos ringing, darkies singing, All the world seems bright." 
 Don't get the wind up, Daisy. I'm here! [The singing stops. A man's voice says "Christ! It's Daisy;  it's little Daisy 'erself!" GIRL stands rigid. The figure  of a soldier appears on the other side of the stile. His cap is  tucked into his belt, his hair is bright in the sunshine; he is  lean, wasted, brown, and laughing.] 
 That's why, soldier. 
 [Who has half drawn his knife] Don't laugh at me, I tell you. 
 [Watchfully] Through the lung. 
 [Fiercely] You won't. I've took her. 
 Don't touch 'im! [GIRL stands hesitating, and suddenly bursts into tears.] 
 Who are you kiddin'? You never loved 'er! 
 I'll fight you for her. [He drops his knife. ] 
 [With clenched fists] I don't want 'is charity. I only want what I can take. 
 You blarsted -! [GIRL springs to him and stops his mouth.] 
 'E's mad!
