 God! What beauty! 
 I said: God! What beauty! 
 [Looking at him] Do you know that I have to repeat everything to you nowadays? 
 That I have to repeat - 
 In all but me. 
 Who wants the natural? 
 [As if to herself] Is the Spring sentiment? 
 [As if against her will--urged by some pent-up force] Beauty, beauty! 
 I will. 
 We owe it more than that--rebellion against the dry-as-dust. 
 It--love. 
 I said: We owe it love. 
 [To herself and the moonlight] Orpheus with his lute! 
 I'm going out. 
 The Christian virtues and the dew. 
 Hypnotized, she slowly sways towards him,  their eyes fixed on each other, till she is quite close. Her  arms go out to him, cling round his neck and, their lips meet.  But as they meet there comes a gasp and the PROFESSOR with  rumpled hair is seen starting from his chair, his hands thrown  up; and at his horrified "Oh!" the Stage is darkened with a  black-out.] [The voice of FRUST is heard speaking.] 
 [Appearing by the stone with her hair down] Here! 
 Yes. 
 It was no dream. He was bringing me to life. 
 Do you suppose I am alive? I'm as dead as Euridice. 
 [Pointing to the litter of papers] Why don't we live, instead of writing of it? [She points out unto the moonlight] What do we get out of life? Money, fame, fashion, talk, learning? Yes. And what good are they? I want to live! 
 [Pointing out into the moonlight] Look! Orpheus with his lute, and nobody can see him. Beauty, beauty, beauty--we let it go. [With sudden passion] Beauty, love, the spring. They should be in us, and they're all outside. 
 [Avoiding him--an a stilly voice] Oh! Go on with your writing! 
 Hysterical? Well! It's over. I'll go and sing. 
 [Standing still and looking at him] Quite! 
 [Softly to herself as he settles down into his chair] Oh! God! [While he takes up a sheet of paper and adjusts himself, she  stands at the window staring with all her might at the boulder,  till from behind it the faun's head and shoulders emerge once  more.] 
 [Startled] Nothing! Nothing! [Her eyes waver to him again, and the FAUN vanishes. She turns  again to look at the boulder; there is nothing there; a little  shiver of wind blows some petals off the trees. She catches one  of them, and turning quickly, goes out through the curtain.]
