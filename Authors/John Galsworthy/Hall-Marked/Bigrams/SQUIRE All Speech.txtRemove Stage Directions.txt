 Here's a bell! re-enter.] Have you tied him properly this time? All right, Ella; all right! He doesn't mean what you mean! 
 Jove! Clever if he can smell anything but himself. Phew! She ought to have the Victoria Cross for goin' in that pond. 
 
 Little beast will fight--must apologise--you were too quick for me -

Afraid we've been an awful nuisance. Hope to make the acquaintance of Mr -of your husband. does so.] I don't know if your husband shoots, but if -
