THE FULL MOON

   _Scene: A shed close to Cloon Station; BartleyFallon is sitting
   gloomily on a box; HyacinthHalvey and ShawnEarly are coming in at
   door_.

_ShawnEarly:_ It is likely the train will not be up to its time,
and cattle being on it for the fair. It's best wait in the shed. Is
that BartleyFallon? What way are you, Bartley?

_BartleyFallon:_ Faith, no way at all. On the drag, on the drag;
striving to put the bad times over me.

_ShawnEarly:_ Is it business with the nine o'clock you have?

_BartleyFallon:_ The wife that is gone visiting to Tubber, and
that has the door locked till such time as she will come back on the
train. And I thought this shed a place where no bad thing would be
apt to happen me, and not to be going through the streets, and the
darkness falling.

_ShawnEarly:_ It is not long till the full moon will be rising.

_BartleyFallon:_ Everything that is bad, the falling
sickness--God save the mark--or the like, should be at its worst at
the full moon. I suppose because it is the leader of the stars.

_ShawnEarly:_ Ah, what could happen any person in the street of
Cloon?

_BartleyFallon:_ There might. Look at Matt Finn, the coffin-maker,
put his hand on a cage the circus brought, and the lion took and
tore it till they stuck him with a fork you'd rise dung with, and at
that he let it drop. And that was a man had never quitted Cloon.

_ShawnEarly:_ I thought you might be sending something to the fair.

_BartleyFallon:_ It isn't to the train I would be trusting
anything I would have to sell, where it might be thrown off the track.
And where would be the use sending the couple of little lambs I have?
It is likely there is no one would ask me where was I going. When
the weight is not in them, they won't carry the price. Sure, the
grass I have is no good, but seven times worse than the road.

_ShawnEarly:_ They are saying there'll be good demand at the fair
of Carrow to-morrow.

_HyacinthHalvey:_ To-morrow the fair day of Carrow? I was not
remembering that.

_BartleyFallon:_ Ah, there won't be many in it, I'm thinking.
There isn't a hungrier village in Connacht, they were telling me,
and it's poor the look of it as well.

_HyacinthHalvey:_ To-morrow the fair day. There will be all sorts
in the streets to-night.

_BartleyFallon:_ The sort that will be in it will be a bad
sort--sievemakers and tramps and neuks.

_HyacinthHalvey:_ The tents on the fair green; there will be
music in it; there was a fiddler having no legs would set men of
threescore years and of fourscore years dancing. I can nearly hear
his tune.

   _(He whistles_ "The Heather Broom.")

_BartleyFallon:_ You are apt to be going there on the train, I
suppose? It is well to be you, Mr. Halvey, having a good place in
the town, and the price of your fare, and maybe six times the price
of it, in your pocket.

_HyacinthHalvey:_ I didn't think of that. I wonder could I
go--for one night only--and see what the lads are doing.

_ShawnEarly:_ Are you forgetting, Mr. Halvey, that you are to
meet his Reverence on the platform that is coming home from drinking
water at the Spa?

_HyacinthHalvey:_ So I can meet him, and get in the train after
him getting out.

   _(Mrs.Broderick and PeterTannian come in.)_

_Mrs.Broderick:_ Is that Mr. Halvey is in it? I was looking for
you at the chapel as I passed, and the Angelus bell after ringing.

_HyacinthHalvey:_ Business I have here, ma'am. I was in dread I
might not be here before the train.

_Mrs.Broderick:_ So you might not, indeed. That nine o'clock
train you can never trust it to be late.

_HyacinthHalvey:_ To meet Father Gregan I am come, and maybe to
go on myself.

_Mrs.Broderick:_ Sure, I knew well you would be in haste to be
before Father Gregan, and we knowing what we know.

_HyacinthHalvey:_ I have no business only to be showing respect
to him.

_ShawnEarly:_ His good word he will give to Mr. Halvey at the
Board, where it is likely he will be made Clerk of the Union next
week.

_Mrs.Broderick:_ His good word he will give to another thing
besides that, I am thinking.

_HyacinthHalvey:_ I don't know what you are talking about.

_Mrs.Broderick:_ Didn't you hear the news, PeterTannian, that
Mr. Halvey is apt to be linked and joined in marriage with MissJoyce,
the priest's housekeeper?

_PeterTannian:_ I to believe all the lies I'd hear, I'd be a
racked man by this.

_Mrs.Broderick:_ What I say now is as true as if you were on the
other side of me. I suppose now the priest is come home there'll be
no delay getting the license.

_HyacinthHalvey:_ It is not so settled as that.

_Mrs.Broderick:_ Why wouldn't it be settled and it being told at
Mrs. Delane's and through the whole world?

_PeterTannian:_ She should be a steady wife for him--a fortied
girl.

_ShawnEarly:_ A very good fortune in the bank they are saying she
has, and she having crossed the ocean twice to America.

_BartleyFallon:_ It's as good for him to have a woman will keep
the door open before him and his victuals ready and a quiet tongue
in her head. Not like that little Tartar of my own.

_Mrs.Broderick_. And an educated woman along with that. A man of
his sort, going to be Clerk of the Union and to be taken up with
books and papers, it's likely he'd die in a week, he to marry a dunce.

_BartleyFallon:_ So it's likely he would.

_Mrs.Broderick:_ A little shop they are saying she will take, for
to open a flour store, and you to be keeping the accounts, the way
you would not spend any waste time.

_HyacinthHalvey:_ I have no mind to be settling myself down yet a
while. I might maybe take a ramble here or there. There's many of my
comrades in the States.

_Mrs.Broderick:_ To go away from Cloon, is it? And why would you
think to do that, and the whole town the same as a father and mother
to you? Sure, the sergeant would live and die with you, and there
are no two from this to Galway as great as yourself and the priest.
To see you coming up the street, and your Dublin top-coat around you,
there are some would give you a salute the same nearly as the Bishop.

_PeterTannian:_ They wouldn't do that maybe and they hearing
things as I heard them.

_HyacinthHalvey:_ What things?

_PeterTannian:_ There was a herd passing through from Carrow. It
is what I heard him saying------

_Mrs.Broderick:_ You heard nothing of Mr. Halvey, but what is
worthy of him. But that's the way always. The most thing a man does,
the less he will get for it after.

_PeterTannian:_ A grand place in Carrow I suppose you had?

_HyacinthHalvey:_ I had plenty of places. Giving out
proclamations--attending waterworks----.

_Mrs.Broderick:_ It is well fitted for any place he is, and all
that was written around him and he coming into Cloon.

_PeterTannian:_ Writing is easy.

_Mrs.Broderick:_ Look at him since he was here, this twelvemonth
back, that he never went into a dance-house or stood at a cross-road,
and never lost a half-an-hour with drink. Made no blunder, made no
rumours. Whatever could be said of his worth, it could not be too
well said.

_HyacinthHalvey:_ Do you think now, ma'am, would it be any harm I
to go spend a day or maybe two days out of this--I to go on the
train----.

_MissJoyce:_ _(At door, coming in backwards.)_ Go back now, go back!
Don't be following after me in through the door! Is Mr. Halvey there?
Don't let her come following me, Mr. Halvey!

_HyacinthHalvey:_ Who is it is in it?

   _(Sound of discordant singing outside.)_

_MissJoyce:_ Cracked Mary it is, that is after coming back this
day from the asylum.

_HyacinthHalvey:_ I never saw her, I think.

_ShawnEarly:_ The creature, she was light this long while and not
good in the head, and at the last lunacy came on her and she was
tied and bound. Sometimes singing and dancing she does be, and
sometimes troublesome.

_MissJoyce:_ They had a right to keep her spancelled in the asylum.
She would begrudge any respectable person to be walking the street.
She'd hoot you, she'd shout you, she'd clap her hands at you. She is
a blight in the town.

_HyacinthHalvey:_ There is a lad along with her.

_ShawnEarly:_ It is Davideen, her brother, that is innocent. He
was left rambling from place to place the time she was put within
walls.

   _(Cracked Mary and Davideen come in.
    MissJoyce clings to Hyacinth's arm.)_

_CrackedMary:_ Give me a charity now, the way I'll be keeping a
little rag on me and a little shoe to my foot. Give me the price of
tobacco and the price of a grain of tea; for tobacco is blessed and
tea is good for the head.

_ShawnEarly:_ Give out now, Davideen, a verse of "The Heather
Broom." That's a splendid tune.

_Davideen: _(Sings.)_

  Oh, don't you remember,
  As it's often I told you,
  As you passed through our kitchen,
  That a new broom sweeps clean?
  Come out now and buy one,
  Come out now and try one--

   _(His voice cracks, and he breaks off, laughing foolishly.)_

_Mrs.Broderick:_ He has a sweet note in his voice, but to know or
to understand what he is doing, he couldn't do it.

_CrackedMary:_ Leave him a while. His song that does be clogged
through the daytime, the same as the sight is clogged with myself. It
isn't but in the night time I can see anything worth while. Davy is
a proper boy, a proper boy; let you leave Davy alone. It was himself
came before me ere yesterday in the morning, and I walking out the
madhouse door.

_ShawnEarly:_ It is often there will fiddlers be waiting to play
for them coming out, that are maybe the finest dancers of the day.

_CrackedMary:_ Waiting before me he was, and no one to give him
knowledge unless it might be the Big Man. I give you my word he near
ate the face off me. As glad to see me he was as if I had dropped
from heaven. Come hither to me, Davy, and give no heed to them. It
is as dull and as lagging as themselves you would be maybe, and the
world to be different and the moon to change its courses with the sun.

_BartleyFallon:_ I never would wish to be put within a madhouse
before I'd die.

_CrackedMary:_ Sorry they were losing me. There was not a better
prisoner in it than my own four bones.

_BartleyFallon:_ Squeals you would hear from it, they were
telling me, like you'd hear at the ringing of the pigs. Savages with
whips beating them the same as hounds. You would not stand and
listen to them for a hundred sovereigns. Of all bad things that can
come upon a man, it is certain the madness is the last.

_MissJoyce:_ It is likely she was well content in it, and the
friends she had being of her own class.

_CrackedMary:_ What way could you make friends with people would
be always talking? Too much of talk and of noise there was in it,
cursing, and praying, and tormenting; some dancing, some singing,
and one writing a letter to a she devil called Lucifer. I not to
close my ears, I would have lost the sound of Davideen's song.

_MissJoyce:_ It was good shelter you got in it through the bad
weather, and not to be out perishing under cold, the same as the
starlings in the snow.

_CrackedMary:_ I was my seven months in it, my seven months and a
day. My good clothes that went astray on me and my boots. My fine
gaudy dress was all moth-eated, that was worked with the wings of
birds. To fall into dust and ashes it did, and the wings rose up
into the high air.

_BartleyFallon_. Take care would the madness catch on to
ourselves the same as the chin-cough or the pock.

_Mrs.Broderick:_ Ah, that's not the way it goes travelling from
one to another, but some that are naturally cracked and inherit it.

_ShawnEarly:_ It is a family failing with her tribe. The most of
them get giddy in their latter end.

_MissJoyce:_ It might be it was sent as a punishment before birth,
for to show the power of God.

_PeterTannian:_ It is tea-drinking does it, and that is the
reason it is on the wife it is apt to fall for the most part.

_Mrs.Broderick:_ Ah, there's some does be thinking their wives
isn't right, and there's others think they are too right. There to
be any fear of me going astray, I give you my word I'd lose my wits
on the moment.

_HyacinthHalvey:_ There are some say it is the moon.

_ShawnEarly:_ So it is too. The time the moon is going back, the
blood that is in a person does be weakening, but when the moon is
strong, the blood that moves strong in the same way. And it to be at
the full, it drags the wits along with it, the same as it drags the
tide.

_Mrs.Broderick:_ Those that are light show off more and have the
talk of twenty the time it is at the full, that is sure enough. And
to hold up a silk handkerchief and to look through it, you would see
the four quarters of the moon; I was often told that.

_MissJoyce:_ It is not you, Mr. Halvey, will give in to an unruly
thing like the moon, that is under no authority, and cannot be put
back, the same as a fast day that would chance to fall upon a feast.

_HyacinthHalvey:_ It is likely it is put in the sky the same as a
clock for our use, the way you would pick knowledge of the weather,
the time the stars would be wild about it.

_Mrs.Broderick:_ That is very nice now. The thing you'd know,
you'd like to go on, and to hear more or less about it.

_MissJoyce:_ _(To H.H.)_ It is a lantern for your own use it will
be to-night, and his Reverence coming home through the street, and
yourself coming along with him to the house.

_Mrs.Broderick:_ That's right, MissJoyce. Keep a good grip of him.
What do you say to him talking a while ago as if his mind was
running on some thought to leave Cloon?

_MissJoyce:_ What way could he leave it?

_HyacinthHalvey:_ No way at all, I'm thinking, unless there would
be a miracle worked by the moon.

_Mrs.Broderick:_ Ah, miracles is gone out of the world this long
time, with education, unless that they might happen in your own
inside.

_MissJoyce:_ I'll go set the table and kindle the fire, and I'll
come back to meet the train with you myself.

_(She goes. A noise heard outside.)_

_HyacinthHalvey:_ What is that now?

_ShawnEarly:_ _(At door.)_ Some noise as of running.

_BartleyFallon:_ _(Going to door.)_ It might chance to be some
prisoner they would be bringing to the train.

_PeterTannian:_ No, but some lads that are running.

   _(They go out. H.H. is going too, but Mrs.Broderick goes before him
   and turns him round in doorway.)_

_Mrs.Broderick:_ Don't be coming out now in the dust that was
formed by the heat is in the breeze. It would be a pity to spoil
your Dublin coat, or your shirt that is that white you would nearly
take it to be blue.

   _(She goes out, pushing him in and shutting door after her.)_

_CrackedMary:_ Ha! ha! ha!

_HyacinthHalvey:_ What is it you are laughing at?

_CrackedMary:_ Ha! ha! ha! It is a very laughable thing now, the
third most laughable thing I ever met with in my lifetime.

_HyacinthHalvey:_ What is that?

_CrackedMary:_ A fine young man to be shut up and bound in a
narrow little shed, and the full moon rising, and I knowing what I
know!

_HyacinthHalvey:_ It's little you are likely to know about me.

_CrackedMary:_ Tambourines and fiddles and pipes--melodeons and
the whistling of drums.

_HyacinthHalvey:_ I suppose it is the Carrow fair you are talking
about.

_CrackedMary:_ Sitting within walls, and a top-coat wrapped
around him, and mirth and music and frolic being in the place we know,
and some dancing sets on the floor.

_HyacinthHalvey:_ I wish I wasn't in this place tonight. I would
like well to be going on the train, if it wasn't for the talk the
neighbours would be making. I would like well to slip away. It is a
long time I am going without any sort of funny comrades.

   _(Goes to door. The others enter quickly, pushing him back.)_

_BartleyFallon:_ Nothing at all to see. It would be best for us
to have stopped where we were.

_Mrs.Broderick:_ Running like foals to see it, and nothing to be
in it worth while.

_HyacinthHalvey:_ What was it was in it?

_ShawnEarly:_ Nothing at all but some lads that were running in
pursuit of a dog.

_BartleyFallon:_ Near knocked us they did, and they coming round
the corner of the wall.

_HyacinthHalvey:_ Is it that it was a mad dog?

_PeterTannian:_ Ah, what mad? Mad dogs are done away with now by
the head Government and muzzles and the police.

_BartleyFallon:_ They are more watchful over them than they used.
But all the same, you to see a strange dog afar off, you would be
uneasy, thinking it might be yourself he would be searching out as
his prey.

_Mrs.Broderick:_ Sure, there did a dog go mad through Galway, and
the whole town rose against him, and flocked him into a corner, and
shot him there. He did no harm after, he being made an end of at the
first.

_ShawnEarly:_ It might be that dog they were pursuing after was
mad, on the head of being under the full moon.

_CrackedMary:_ _(Jumping up excitedly.)_ That mad dog, he is a
Dublin dog; he is betune you and Belfast--he is running ahead--you
couldn't keep up with him.

_HyacinthHalvey:_ There is one, so, mad upon the road.

_CrackedMary:_ There is police after him, but they cannot come up
with him; he destroyed a splendid sow; nine bonavs they buried or
less.

_ShawnEarly:_ What place is he gone now?

_CrackedMary:_ He made off towards Craughwell, and he bit a fine
young man.

_BartleyFallon:_ So he would too. Sure, when a mad dog would be
going about, on horseback or wherever you are, you're ruined.

_CrackedMary:_ That dog is going on all the time; he wouldn't stop,
but go ahead and bring that mouthful with him. He is still on the
road; he is keeping the middle of the road; they say he is as big as
a calf.

_HyacinthHalvey:_ It is the police I have a right to forewarn to
go after him.

_CrackedMary:_ The motor cars is going to get out to track him,
for fear he would destroy the world!

_Mrs.Broderick:_ That is a very nice thought now, to be sending
the motor cars after him to overturn and to crush him the same as an
ass-car in their path.

_CrackedMary:_ You can't save yourself from a dog; he is after
his own equals, dogs. He is doing every harm. They are out night and
day.

_ShawnEarly:_ Sure, a mad dog would go from this to Kinvara in a
half a minute, like the train.

_CrackedMary:_ He won't stay in this country down--he goes the
straight road--he takes by the wind. He is as big as a yearling calf.

_Mrs.Broderick:_ I wouldn't ever forgive myself I to see him.

_CrackedMary:_ He is not very heavy yet. There is only the relics
in him.

_HyacinthHalvey:_ They have a right to bring their rifles in
their hand.

_CrackedMary:_ The police is afraid of their life. They wrote for
motor cars to follow him. Sure, he'd destroy the beasts of the field.
A milch cow, he to grab at her, she's settled. Terrible wicked he is;
he's as big as five dogs, and he does be very strong. I hope in the
Lord he'll be caught. It will be a blessing from the Almighty God to
kill that dog.

_HyacinthHalvey:_ He is surely the one is raging through the
street.

_PeterTannian:_ Why wouldn't he be him? Is it likely there would
be two of them in it at the one time?

_ShawnEarly:_ A queer cut of a dog he was; a lurcher, a bastard
hound.

_PeterTannian:_ I would say him to be about the size of the foal
of a horse.

_Mrs.Broderick:_ Didn't he behave well not to do ourselves an
injury?

_BartleyFallon:_ It is likely he will do great destruction. I
wouldn't say but I felt the weight of him and his two paws around my
neck.

_HyacinthHalvey:_ I will go out following him.

_ShawnEarly:_ _(Holding him)_. Oh, let you not endanger yourself!
It is the peelers should go follow him, that are armed with their
batons and their guns.

_HyacinthHalvey:_ I'll go. He might do some injury going through
the town.

_Mrs.Broderick:_ Ah now, it is not yourself we would let go into
danger! It is PeterTannian should go, if any person should go.

_PeterTannian:_ Is it HyacinthHalvey you are taking to be so far
before myself?

_Mrs.Broderick:_ Why wouldn't he be before you?

_PeterTannian:_ Ask him what was he in Carrow? Ask was he a sort
of a corner-boy, ringing the bell, pumping water, gathering a few
coppers in the daytime for to scatter on a game of cards.

_HyacinthHalvey:_ Stop your lies and your chat!

_Mrs.Broderick:_ _(to Tannian_)_ You are going light in the head to
talk that way.

_ShawnEarly:_ He is, and queer in the mind. Take care did he get
a bite from the dog, that left some venom working in his blood.

_HyacinthHalvey:_ So he might, and he having a sort of a little
rent in his sleeve.

_PeterTannian:_ I to have got a bite from the dog, is it? I did
not come anear him at all. You to strip me as bare as winter you
will not find the track of his teeth. It is ShawnEarly was nearer
to him than what I was.

_ShawnEarly:_ I was not nearer, or as near as what Mrs.Broderick
was.

_Mrs.Broderick:_ I made away when I saw him. My chest is not the
better of it yet. Since I left off fretting I got gross. I am that
nervous I would run from a blessed sheep, let alone a dog.

_ShawnEarly:_ To see any of the signs of madness upon him, it is
Mr. Halvey the sergeant would look to for to make his report.

_HyacinthHalvey:_ So I would make a report.

_PeterTannian:_ Is it that you lay down you can see signs? Is
that the learning they were giving you in Carrow?

_Mrs.Broderick:_ Don't be speaking with him at all. It is easy
know the signs. A person to be laughing and mocking, and that would
not have the same habits with yourself, or to have no fear of things
you would be in dread of, or to be using a different class of food.

_PeterTannian:_ I use no food but clean food.

_HyacinthHalvey:_ To be giddy in the head is a sign, and to be
talking of things that passed years ago.

_PeterTannian:_ I am talking of nothing but the thing I have a
right to talk of.

_Mrs.Broderick:_ To be nervous and thinking and pausing, and
playing with knicknacks.

_PeterTannian:_ It never was my habit to be playing with
knicknacks.

_BartleyFallon:_ When the master in the school where I was went
queer, he beat me with two clean rods, and wrote my name with my own
blood.

_Mrs.Broderick:_ To take the shoe off their foot, and to hit out
right and left with it, bawling their life out, tearing their clothes,
scattering and casting them in every part; or to run naked through
the town, and all the people after them.

_ShawnEarly:_ To be jumping the height of trees they do be, and
all the people striving to slacken them.

_HyacinthHalvey:_ To steal prayer-books and rosaries, and to be
saying prayers they never could keep in mind before.

_Mrs.Broderick:_ Very strong, that they could leap a
wall--jumping and pushing and kicking--or to tie people to one
another with a rope.

_ShawnEarly:_ Any fear of any person here being violent, Mr.
Halvey will get him put under restraint.

_PeterTannian:_ Is it myself you are thinking to put under
restraint? Would a man would be pushing and kicking and tearing his
clothes, be able to do arithmetic on a board? Look now at that.
_(Chalks figures on door.)_ Three and three makes six!--and three--

_Mrs.Broderick:_ I'm no hand at figuring, but I can say out a
blessed hymn, what any person with the mind gone contrary in them
could not do. Hearken now till you'll know is there confusion in my
mind. _(Sings.)_

  Mary Broderick is my name;
    Fiddane was my station;
  Cloon is my dwelling-place;
    And _(I hope)_ heaven is my destination.

  Mary Broderick is my name,
    Cloon was my--

_CrackedMary:_ _(With a cackle of delight.)_ Give heed to them now,
Davideen! That's the way the crazed people used to be going on in the
place where I was, every one thinking the other to be cracked.

_HyacinthHalvey:_ _(To Tannian.)_ Look now at your great figuring!
Argus with his hundred eyes wouldn't know is that a nought or is it a
nine without a tail.

_PeterTannian:_ Leave that blame on a little ridge that is in the
nature of the chalk. Look now at Mary Broderick, that it has failed
to word out her verse.

_Mrs.Broderick:_ Ah, what signifies? I'd never get light greatly.
It wouldn't be worth while I to go mad.

   _(BartleyFallon gives a deep groan.)_

_ShawnEarly:_ What is on you, Bartley?

_BartleyFallon:_ I'm in dread it is I myself has got the venom
into my blood.

_HyacinthHalvey:_ What makes you think that?

_BartleyFallon:_ It's a sort of a thing would be apt to happen me,
and any malice to fall within the town at all.

_Mrs.Broderick:_ Give heed to him, HyacinthHalvey; you are the
most man we have to baffle any wrong thing coming in our midst!

_HyacinthHalvey:_ Is it that you are feeling any pain as of a
wound or a sore?

_BartleyFallon:_ Some sort of a little catch I'm thinking there
is in under my knee. I would feel no pain unless I would turn it
contrary.

_HyacinthHalvey:_ What class of feeling would you say you are
feeling?

_BartleyFallon:_ I am feeling as if the five fingers of my hand
to be lessening from me, the same as five farthing dips the heat of
the sun would be sweating the tallow from.

_HyacinthHalvey:_ That is a strange account.

_BartleyFallon:_ And a sort of a megrim in my head, the same as a
sheep would get a fit of staggers in a field.

_HyacinthHalvey:_ That is what I would look for. Is there some
sort of a roaring in your ear?

_BartleyFallon:_ There is, there is, as if I would hear voices
would be talking.

_HyacinthHalvey:_ Would you feel any wish to go tearing and
destroying?

_BartleyFallon:_ I would indeed, and there to be an enemy upon my
path. Would you say now, Widow Broderick, am I getting anyway flushy
in the face?

_Mrs.Broderick:_ Don't leave your eye off him for pity's sake. He
is reddening as red as a rose.

_BartleyFallon:_ I could as if walk on the wind with lightness.
Something that is rising in my veins the same as froth would be
rising on a pint.

_HyacinthHalvey:_ It is the doctor I'd best call for--and maybe
the sergeant and the priest.

_BartleyFallon:_ There are three thoughts going through my
mind--to hang myself or to drown myself, or to cut my neck with a
reaping-hook.

_Mrs.Broderick:_ It is the doctor will serve him best, where it
is the mad blood that should be bled away. To break up eggs, the
white of them, in a tin can, will put new blood in him, and whiskey,
and to taste no food through twenty-one days.

_BartleyFallon:_ I'm thinking so long a fast wouldn't serve me. I
wouldn't wish the lads will bear my body to the grave, to lay down
there was nothing within it but a grasshopper or a wisp of dry grass.

_ShawnEarly:_ No, but to cut a piece out of his leg the doctor
will, the way the poison will get no leave to work.

_PeterTannian:_ Or to burn it with red-hot irons, the way it will
not scatter itself and grow. There does a doctor do that out in
foreign.

_Mrs.Broderick:_ It would be more natural to cut the leg off him
in some sort of a Christian way.

_ShawnEarly:_ If it was a pig was bit, or a sow or a bonav, it to
show the signs, it would be shot, if it was a whole fleet of them
was in it.

_Mrs.Broderick:_ I knew of a man that was butler in a big house
was bit, and they tied him first and smothered him after, and his
master shot the dog. A splendid shot he was; the thing he'd not see
he'd hit it the same as the thing he'd see. I heard that from an
outside neighbour of my own, a woman that told no lies.

_ShawnEarly:_ Sure, they did the same thing to a high-up lady
over in England, and she after being bit by her own little spaniel
and it having a ring around its neck.

_PeterTannian:_ That is the only best thing to do. Whether the
bite is from a dog, or a cat, or whatever it may be, to put the
quilt and the blankets on the person and smother him in the bed. To
smother them out-and-out you should, before the madness will work.

_HyacinthHalvey:_ I'd be loth he to be shot or smothered. I'd
sooner to give him a chance in the asylum.

_Mrs.Broderick:_ To keep him there and to try him through three
changes of the moon. It's well for you, Bartley, Mr. Halvey being in
charge of you, that is known to be a tender man.

_PeterTannian:_ He to have got a bite and to go biting others, he
would put in them the same malice. It is the old people used to tell
that down, and they must have had some reason doing that.

_ShawnEarly:_ To get a bite of a dog you must chance your life.
There is no doubt at all about that. It might work till the time of
the new moon or the full moon, and then they must be shot or
smothered.

_HyacinthHalvey:_ It is a pity there to be no cure found for it
in the world.

_ShawnEarly:_ There never came out from the Almighty any cure for
a mad dog.

   _(BartleyFallon has been edging towards door.)_

_ShawnEarly:_ Oh! stop him and keep a hold of him, Mr. Halvey!

_HyacinthHalvey:_ Stop where you are.

_BartleyFallon:_ Isn't it enough to have madness before me, that
you will not let me go fall in my own choice place?

_HyacinthHalvey:_ The neighbours would think it bad of me to let
a raving man out into their midst.

_BartleyFallon:_ Is it to shoot me you are going?

_HyacinthHalvey:_ I will call to the doctor to say is the padded
room at the workhouse the most place where you will be safe, till
such time as it will be known did the poison wear away.

_BartleyFallon:_ I will not go in it! It is likely I might be
forgot in it, or the nurses to be in dread to bring me nourishment,
and they to hear me barking within the door. I'm thinking it was
allotted by nature I never would die an easy death.

_HyacinthHalvey:_ I will keep a watch over you myself.

_BartleyFallon:_ Where's the use of that the time the breath will
be gone out of me, and you maybe playing cards on my coffin, and I
having nothing around or about me but the shroud, and the habit, and
the little board?

_HyacinthHalvey:_ Sure, I cannot leave you the way you are.

_BartleyFallon:_ It is what I ever and always heard, a dog to
bite you, all you have to do is to take a pinch of its hair and to
lay it into the wound.

_Mrs.Broderick:_ So I heard that myself. A dog to bite any person
he is entitled to be plucked of his hair.

_HyacinthHalvey:_ I'll go out; I might chance to see him.

_Mrs.Broderick:_ You will not, without getting advice from the
priest that is coming in the train. Let his Reverence come into this
place, and say is it Bartley or is it PeterTannian was done
destruction on by the dog.

_ShawnEarly:_ There is a surer way than that.

_Mrs.Broderick:_ What way?

_ShawnEarly:_ It takes madness to find out madness. Let you call
to the cracked woman that should know.

_HyacinthHalvey:_ Come hither, Mary, and tell us is there any one
of your own sort in this shed?

_Mrs.Broderick:_ That is a good thought. It is only themselves
that recognise one another.

_BartleyFallon:_ Do not ask her! I will not leave it to her!

_Mrs.Broderick:_ Sure, she cannot say more than what yourself has
said against yourself.

_BartleyFallon:_ I'm in dread she might know too much, and be
telling out what is within in my mind.

_HyacinthHalvey:_ That's foolishness. These are not the ancient
times, when Ireland was full of haunted people.

_BartleyFallon:_ Is a man having a wife and three acres of land
to be put under the judgment of a witch?

_HyacinthHalvey:_ I would not give in to any pagan thing, but to
recognise one of her own sort, that is a thing can be understood.

_Mrs.Broderick:_ So it could be too, the same as witnesses in a
court.

_BartleyFallon:_ I will not give in to going to demons or druids
or freemasons! Wasn't there enough of misfortune set before my path
through every day of my lifetime without it to be linked with me
after my death? Is it that you would force me to lose the comforts
of heaven and to get the poverty of hell? I tell you I will have no
trade with witches! I would sooner go face the featherbeds.

_HyacinthHalvey:_ Say out, girl, do you see any craziness here or
anything of the sort?

_CrackedMary:_ Every day in the year there comes some malice into
the world, and where it comes from is no good place.

_Mrs.Broderick:_ That is it, a venomous dew, as in the year of
the famine. There is no astronomer can say it is from the earth or
the sky.

_HyacinthHalvey:_ It is what we are asking you, did any of that
malice get its scope in this place?

_CrackedMary:_ That was settled in Mayo two thousand years ago.

_Mrs.Broderick:_ Ah, there's no head or tail to that one's story.
You 'd be left at the latter end the same as at the commencement.

_HyacinthHalvey:_ That dog you were talking of, that is raging
through the district and the town--did it leave any madness after it?

_CrackedMary:_ It will go in the wind, there is a certain time
for that. It might go off in the wind again. It might go shaping off
and do no harm.

_BartleyFallon:_ Where is that dog presently, till some person
might go pluck out a few ribs of its hair?

_CrackedMary:_ Raging ever and always it is, raging wild. Sure,
that is a dog was in it before the foundations of the world.

_PeterTannian:_ Who is it now that venom fell on, whatever
beast's jaws may have scattered it?

_CrackedMary:_ It is the full moon knows that. The moon to
slacken it is safe, there is no harm in it. Almighty God will do
that much. He'll slacken it like you 'd slacken lime.

_ShawnEarly:_ There is reason in what she is saying. Set open the
door and let the full moon call its own!

_BartleyFallon:_ Don't let in the rays of it upon us or I'm a
gone man. It to shine on them that are going wrong in the head, it
would raise a great stir in the mind. Sure, it's in the asylum at
that time they do have whips to chastise them.

   _(Goes to corner.)_

_CrackedMary:_ That's it. The moon is terrible. The full moon
cracks them out and out, any one that would have any spleen or any
relics in them.

_Mrs.Broderick:_ Do not let in the light of it. I would scruple
to look at it myself.

_CrackedMary:_ Let you throw open the door, Davideen. It is not
ourselves are in dread that the white man in the sky will be calling
names after us and ridiculing us. Ha! ha! I might be as foolish as
yourselves and as fearful, but for the Almighty that left a little
cleft in my skull, that would let in His candle through the night
time.

_HyacinthHalvey:_ Hurry on now, tell us is there any one in this
place is wild and astray like yourself.

   _(He opens the door. The light falls on him.)_

_CrackedMary:_ _(Putting her hand on him.)_ There was great
shouting in the big round house, and you coming into it last night.

_HyacinthHalvey:_ What are you saying? I never went frolicking in
the night time since the day I came into Cloon.

_CrackedMary:_ We were talking of it a while ago. I knew you by
the smile and by the laugh of you. A queen having a yellow dress,
and the hair on her smooth like marble. All the dead of the village
were in it, and of the living myself and yourself.

_HyacinthHalvey:_ I thought it was of Carrow she was talking; it
is of the other world she is raving, and of the shadow-shapes of the
forth.

_CrackedMary:_ You have the door open--the speckled horses are
on the road!--make a leap on the horse as it goes by, the horse that
is without a rider. Can't you hear them puffing and roaring? Their
breath is like a fog upon the air.

_HyacinthHalvey:_ What you hear is but the train puffing afar off.

_CrackedMary:_ Make a snap at the bridle as it passes by the bush
in the western gap. Run out now, run, where you have the bare ridge
of the world before you, and no one to take orders from but yourself,
maybe, and God.

_HyacinthHalvey:_ Ah, what way can I run to any place!

_CrackedMary:_ Stop where you are, so. In my opinion it is little
difference the moon can see between the whole of ye. Come on,
Davideen, come out now, we have the wideness of the night before us.
O golden God! All bad things quieten in the night time, and the ugly
thing itself will put on some sort of a decent face! Come out now to
the night that will give you the song, and will show myself out as
beautiful as Helen of the Greek gods, that hanged herself the day
there first came a wrinkle on her face!

_Davideen: _(Coming close, and taking her hand as he sings.)_

  Oh! don't you remember
  What our comrades called to us
  And they footing steps
  At the call of the moon?
  Come out to the rushes,
  Come out to the bushes,
  Where the music is called
  By the lads of Queen Anne!

   _(They look beautiful. They dance and sing in perfect time
    as they go out.)_

_PeterTannian:
   _(Closing the door, and pointing at Hyacinth, who stands gazing
   after them, and when the door is shut sits down thinking deeply.)_
It is on him her judgment fell, and a clear judgment.

_ShawnEarly:_ She gave out that award fair enough.

_PeterTannian:_ Did you take notice, and he coming into the shed,
he had like some sort of a little twist in his walk?

_Mrs.Broderick:_ I would be loth to think there would be any
poison lurking in his veins. Where now would it come from, and
Cracked Mary's dog being as good as no dog at all?

_PeterTannian:_ It might chance, and he a child in the cradle, to
get the bite of a dog. It might be only now, its full time being come,
its power would begin to work.

_Mrs.Broderick:_ So it would too, and he but to see the shadow of
the dog bit him in a body glass, or in the waves, and he himself
looking over a boat, and as if called to throw himself in the tide.
But I would not have thought it of Mr. Halvey. Well, it's as hard to
know what might be spreading abroad in any person's mind, as to put
the body of a horse out through a cambric needle.

   _(Hyacinth looks at them.)_

_ShawnEarly:_ Be quiet now, he is going to say some word.

_HyacinthHalvey:_ There is a thought in my mind. I think it was
coming this good while.

_ShawnEarly:_ Whisht now and listen.

_HyacinthHalvey:_ I made a great mistake coming into this place.

_PeterTannian:_ There was some mistake made anyway.

_HyacinthHalvey:_ It is foolishness kept me in it ever since. It is too
big a name was put upon me.

_PeterTannian:_ It is the power of the moon is forcing the truth
out of him.

_HyacinthHalvey:_ Every person in the town giving me out for more
than I am. I got too much of that in the heel.

_ShawnEarly:_ He is talking queer now anyway.

_HyacinthHalvey:_ Calling to me every little minute--expecting me
to do this thing and that thing--watching me the same as a watchdog,
their eyes as if fixed upon my face.

_Mrs.Broderick:_ To be giving out such strange thoughts, he
hasn't much brains left around him.

_HyacinthHalvey:_ I_ looking to be Clerk of the Union, and the
place I had giving me enough to do, and too much to do. Tied on this
side, tied on that side. I to be bothered with business through the
holy livelong day!

_PeterTannian:_ It is good pay he got with it. Eighty pounds a
year doesn't come on the wind.

_HyacinthHalvey:_ In danger to be linked and wed--I never
ambitioned it--with a woman would want me to be earning through
every day of the year.

_ShawnEarly:_ He is a gone man surely.

_HyacinthHalvey:_ The wide ridge of the world before me, and to
have no one to look to for orders; that would be better than roast
and boiled and all the comforts of the day. I declare to goodness,
and I 'd nearly take my oath, I 'd sooner be among a fleet of tinkers,
than attending meetings of the Board!

_Mrs.Broderick:_ If there are fairies in it, it is in the fairies
he is.

_PeterTannian:_ Give me a hold of that chain.

_Mrs.Broderick:_ What is it you are about to do?

_PeterTannian:_ To bind him to the chair I will before he will
burst out wild mad. Come over here, BartleyFallon, and lend a hand
if you can.

   _(BartleyFallon appears from corner with a_ _chicken crate over
   his head.)_

_Mrs.Broderick:_ O Bartley, that is the strangest lightness ever
I saw, to go bind a chicken crate around your skull!

_BartleyFallon:_ Will you tighten the knots I have tied, Peter
Tannian! I am in dread they might slacken or fail.

_ShawnEarly:_ Was there ever seen before this night such power to
be in the moon!

_BartleyFallon:_ It would seem to be putting very wild unruly
thoughts a-through me, stirring up whatever spleen or whatever
relics was left in me by the nature of the dog.

_PeterTannian:_ Is it that you think those rods, spaced wide, as
they are, will keep out the moon from entering your brain?

_BartleyFallon:_ There does great strength come at the time the
wits would be driven out of a person. I never was handled by a
policeman--but once--and never hit a blow on any man. I would not
wish to destroy my neighbour or to have his blood on my hands.

_ShawnEarly:_ It is best keep out of his reach.

_BartleyFallon:_ The way I have this fixed, there is no person
will be the worse for me. I to rush down the street and to meet with
my most enemy in some lonesome craggy place, it would fail me, and I
thrusting for it to scatter any share of poison in his body or to
sink my teeth in his skin. I wouldn't wonder I to have hung for some
of you, and that plan not to have come into my head.

   _(Whistle of train heard.)_

_HyacinthHalvey:_ _(Getting up.)_ I have my mind made up, I am
going out of this on that train.

_PeterTannian:_ You are not going so easy as what you think.

_HyacinthHalvey:_ Let you mind your own business.

_PeterTannian:_ I am well able to mind it.

_HyacinthHalvey:_ _(Throwing off top-coat.)_ You cannot keep me here.

_PeterTannian:_ Give me a hand with the chain.
   _(They throw it round Hyacinth and hold him.)_

_HyacinthHalvey:_ Is it out of your senses you are gone?

_PeterTannian:_ Not at all, but yourself that is gone raving mad
from the fury and the strength of some dog.

_MissJoyce:_ _(At door.)_ Are you there, HyacinthHalvey? The train
is in. Come forward now, and give a welcome to his Reverence.

_HyacinthHalvey:_ Let me go out of this!

_MissJoyce:_ You are near late as it is. The train is about to
start.

_HyacinthHalvey:_ Let me go, or I'll tear the heart out of ye!

_ShawnEarly:_ Oh, he is stark, staring mad!

_HyacinthHalvey:_ Mad, am I? Bit by a dog, am I? You'll see am I
mad! I'll show madness to you! Let go your hold or I'll skin you!
I'll destroy you! I'll bite you! I'm a red enemy to the whole of you!
Leave go your grip! Yes, I'm mad! Bow wow wow, wow wow!

   _(They let go and fall back in terror, and he rushes out of the
    door.)_

_MissJoyce:_ What at all has happened? Where is he gone?

_ShawnEarly:_ To the train he is gone, and away in it he is gone.

_MissJoyce:_ He gave some sort of a bark or a howl.

_ShawnEarly:_ He is gone clean mad. Great arguing he had, and
leaping and roaring.

_BartleyFallon:_ _(Taking off crate.)_ He went very near to tear
us all asunder. I declare I amn't worth a match.

_Mrs.Broderick:_ He made a reel in my head, till I don't know am
I right myself.

_ShawnEarly:_ Bawling his life out, tearing his clothes, tearing
and eating them. Look at his top-coat he left after him.

_BartleyFallon:_ He poured all over with pure white foam.

_PeterTannian:_ There now is an end of your elegant man.

_ShawnEarly:_ Bit he was with the mad dog that went tearing, and
lads chasing him a while ago.

_MissJoyce:_ Sure that was Tannian's own dog, that had a bit of
meat snapped from Quirke's ass-car. He is without this door now.
_(All look out.)_ He has the appearance of having a full meal taken.

_BartleyFallon:_ And they to be saying I went mad. That is the
way always, and a thing to be tasked to me that was not in it at all.

_Mrs.Broderick:_ _(Laying her hand on MissJoyce's shoulder.)_
Take comfort now; and if it was the moon done all, and has your
bachelor swept, let you not begrudge it its full share of praise for
the hand it had in banishing a strange bird, might have gone wild
and bawling like eleven, and you after being wed with him, and would
maybe have put a match to the roof. And hadn't you the luck of the
world now, that you did not give notice to the priest!
