it in the paper this morning. They were talking of it in the Courts! Here it is again. "Body of a man was found this morning under an archway in Glove Lane. From marks about the throat grave suspicion of foul play are entertained. The body had apparently been robbed." My God! You saw this in the paper and dreamed it. D'you understand, Larry?--you dreamed it. Did you take anything from the-body? "Patrick Walenn"--Was that his name? "Simon's Hotel, Farrier Street, London." No!--that makes me - What in God's name made you come here and tell me? Don't you know I'm--I'm within an ace of a Judgeship? Love! Steady, Larry! Let's think it out. You weren't seen, you say? When did you leave the girl again? Where did you go? To Fitzroy Street? What have you done since? Not been out? Not seen the girl? Will she give you away? Or herself hysteria? Who knows of your relations with her? No one? Did anyone see you go in last night, when you first went to her? Give them to me. LARRY takes two keys from his pocket and hands them to his brother. What! A girl like that? What else have you that connects you with her? In your rooms? Photographs? Letters? Sure? No one saw you going back to her? Nor leave in the morning? You can't be certain. You were fortunate. Sit down again, man. I must think. He turns to the fire and leans his elbows on the mantelpiece and his head on his hands. LARRY Sits down again obediently. It's all too unlikely. It's monstrous! This Walenn--was it his first reappearance after an absence? How did he find out where she was? How drunk were you? How much had you drunk, then? You say you didn't mean to kill him. That's something. She was hanging on to him, you say?--That's ugly. D'you mean she--loves you? Can a woman like that love? I'm trying to get at truth. If you want me to help, I must know everything. What makes you think she's fond of you? I'm talking of love. What made you choose that archway? Did his face look as if he'd been strangled? Did it? Very disfigured
