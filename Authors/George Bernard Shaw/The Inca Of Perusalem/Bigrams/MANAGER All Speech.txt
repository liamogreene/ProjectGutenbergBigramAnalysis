 I am sorry I am unable to accommodate Your Highness on the first floor. 
 We could prepare a room in the annexe -- 
 The rooms are quite as good up here. There is less noise; and there is the lift. If Your Highness desires anything, there is the telephone -- 
 Can I take any order? Some tea? 
 Pardon, Your Highness; but I have received an urgent inquiry for rooms from an English family of importance; and I venture to ask you to let me know how long you intend to honor us with your presence. 
 Twenty minutes! 
 I do not understand. 
 But I have explained. The first floor is occupied. At least -- 
 It is occupied. 
 But Her Highness was so gracious. I did not know that Her Highness was at all particular. 
[appealing to the Princess] Can Your Highness believe this of me? Have I had the misfortune to offend Your Highness? 
 Oh please, mademoiselle. Believe me: our only wish is to make you perfectly comfortable. But in consequence of the war, all royal personages now practise a rigid economy, and desire us to treat them like their poorest subjects. 
 There are basins with hot and cold taps. 
[gallant] You are hard to please, mademoiselle. 
 Your Highness, an officer asks to see you on behalf of the Inca of Perusalem. 
 On important business, he says, Your Highness. Captain Duval. 
 Captain Duval. The Inca, in military uniform, advances with a marked and imposing stage walk; stops; orders the trembling Manager by a gesture to place the jewel case on the table; dismisses him with a frown; touches his helmet graciously to Ermyntrude; and takes off his cloak.
