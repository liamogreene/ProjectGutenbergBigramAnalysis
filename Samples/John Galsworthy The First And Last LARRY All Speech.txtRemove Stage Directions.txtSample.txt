 turns away and walks up and down; then, stopping at LARRY's chair, he speaks. I promise. "Unstable as water, he shall not excel!" Very little. You're very good, Keith; you've always been very good to me--I don't know why. I'd better have done with it. KErra. You fool! Give that to me. No. White magic, Keith!
