 He did not, Mr. Hazel. Ah, he won't be long coming. It's seldom he does be late. It is, sir. Boiled beef and parsnips, the same as every Monday for all comers, and an apple pie for yourself and Mr. Mineog. I will, sir. 
 I'll go in search of something to stop it, sir. This bit of a board I brought is too unshapely. I will, sir. 
 Wait now, sir, till I'll aid you to handle Mr. Hazel's coat. 
 The apple pie, Sir. 
 Is there anything after happening, Mr. Hazel? Ah, what signifies? There to be more of battles in the world there would be less of wars. 
 Are these belonging to you, Mr. Mineog?
