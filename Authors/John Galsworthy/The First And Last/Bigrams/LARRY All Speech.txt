 [In a stifled voice] Only I--Larry. 
 [In a whisper] Yes, Keith. 
 It's true. [KEITH steps quickly forward and stares down into his brother's  eyes, where is a horrified wonder, as if they would never again  get on terms with his face.] 
 [In a shrill outburst] It's true, I tell you; I've killed a man. 
 Whom should I tell, Keith? I came to ask what I'm to do -- give myself up, or what? 
 Last night. 
 My head! Yes! It's like this, Keith--there's a girl - 
 A Polish girl. She--her father died over here when she was sixteen, and left her all alone. There was a mongrel living in the same house who married her--or pretended to. She's very pretty, Keith. He left her with a baby coming. She lost it, and nearly starved. Then another fellow took her on, and she lived with him two years, till that brute turned up again and made her go back to him. He used to beat her black and blue. He'd left her again when--I met her. She was taking anybody then. [He stops, passes his hand over his lips, looks up at KEITH, and goes on defiantly] I never met a sweeter woman, or a truer, that I swear. Woman! She's only twenty now! When I went to her last night, that devil had found her out again. He came for me--a bullying, great, hulking brute. Look! [He touches a dark mark on his forehead] I took his ugly throat, and when I let go--[He stops and his hands drop.] 
 [In a smothered voice] Dead, Keith. I never knew till afterwards that she was hanging on to him--to h-help me. [Again he wrings his hands.] 
 We--we sat by it a long time. 
 Then I carried it on my back down the street, round a corner, to an archway. 
 About fifty yards. 
 No. 
 Three in the morning. 
 Went back to her. 
 She way lonely and afraid. So was I, Keith. 
 Forty-two Borrow Square, Soho. 
 Corner of Glove Lane. 
 [Wistfully] If only I had, Keith! [KEITH makes a movement of his hands almost like his brother's.] 
 [Drawing au envelope from his pocket] This dropped out while we were struggling. 
 [Simply] Yes. You must know what I ought to do. I didn't, mean to kill him, Keith. I love the girl--I love her. What shall I do? 
 [In a flash] Love!--That swinish brute! A million creatures die every day, and not one of them deserves death as he did. But but I feel it here. [Touching his heart] Such an awful clutch, Keith. Help me if you can, old man. I may be no good, but I've never hurt a fly if I could help it. [He buries his face in his hands.] 
 It's a dark place, and dead night. 
 About seven. 
 To my rooms. 
 Yes. 
 Sat there--thinking. 
 No. 
 Never. 
 No. 
 No one. 
 I don't know who should, Keith. 
 No. She lives on the ground floor. I've got keys. 
 [Rising] I can't be cut off from her! 
 [With a flash] Yes, a girl like that. 
 Nothing. 
 No. 
 Nothing. 
 I am. 
 [Sighing it out] Yes. 
 Yes. 
 I don't know. 
 I was not drunk. 
 A little claret--nothing! 
 God knows. 
 He hit me. [He holds up his hands] I didn't know I was so strong. 
 She was scared for me. 
 [Simply] Yes, Keith. 
 [Flashing out] By God, you are a stony devil! Why not? 
 [With a crazy laugh] Oh, you lawyer! Were you never in a woman's arms? 
 [Fiercely] So am I. I tell you she's devoted. Did you ever pick up a lost dog? Well, she has the lost dog's love for me. And I for her; we picked each other up. I've never felt for another woman what I feel for her--she's been the saving of me! 
 It was the first dark place. 
 Don't! 
 Yes. 
 No. 
 [In an outburst] I'm not made of iron, like you. Why not? If you had done it -! 
 [Wearily] I don't know. 
 In Pimlico, I think. 
 Nearly a year. 
 Till she met me. 
 [Starting up] Keith! 
 [Subsiding] Yes. 
 I think so. 
 I've never heard. KEITH turns away and walks up and down; then, stopping at  LARRY's chair, he speaks. 
 I promise. 
 [With one of his flashes] "Unstable as water, he shall not excel!" 
 Very little. 
 [Humbly] You're very good, Keith; you've always been very good to me--I don't know why. 
 [Bringing out a little box] I'd better have done with it. KErra. You fool! Give that to me. 
 [With a strange smite] No. [He holds up a tabloid between finger and thumb] White magic, Keith! Just one--and they may do what they like to you, and you won't know it. Snap your fingers at all the tortures. It's a great comfort! Have one to keep by you? 
 [Replacing the box] Not quite! You've never killed a man, you see. [He gives that crazy laugh.] D'you remember that hammer when we were boys and you riled me, up in the long room? I had luck then. I had luck in Naples once. I nearly killed a driver for beating his poor brute of a horse. But now--! My God! [He covers his face.] KEITH touched, goes up and lays a hand on his shoulder. 
 All right, Keith; I'll try. 
 [Moving towards the door] Don't keep me longer than you can help, Keith. 
 Keith! 
 I've been waiting in for you all day. I couldn't stand it any longer. 
 Well, what's the sentence, brother? Transportation for life and then to be fined forty pounds'? 
 Must. 
 [Putting his arms round WANDA, who is standing motionless with her eyes fixed on him] Together, Keith? 
 Swear? 
 What? 
 I've seen nothing, not even a paper. 
 With murder? 
 What was he like, Keith? 
 What! [In an awed voice] Why, I saw him--after I left you last night. 
 By the archway. 
 It draws you, Keith. KErra. You're mad, I think. 
 I talked to him, and he said, "Thank you for this little chat. It's worth more than money when you're down." Little grey man like a shaggy animal. And a newspaper boy came up and said: "That's right, guv'nors! 'Ere's where they found the body--very spot. They 'yn't got 'im yet." [He laughs; and the terrified girl presses herself against him.] An innocent man! 
 [In a whisper] In the sun! "A cup of wine and thou." [Suddenly] How can I, Keith? I must see how it goes with that poor devil. 
 Not? 
 [With a strange smile--to the girl] Shall we, Wanda? 
 [Picking the notes up from the couch] Take them back, Keith. 
 It won't do, Keith. I must see it out. 
 I've still got some kind of honour. If I clear out before I know, I shall have none--nor peace. Take them, Keith, or I'll put them in the fire. 
 [Hanging his head] I'm awfully sorry, Keith; awfully sorry, old man. 
 I know. I'll do nothing without you, Keith. 
 You can trust me. 
 I swear. 
 Good night! KEITH goes. LARRY Sits down on the couch sand stares at the  fire. The girl steals up and slips her arms about him. 
 An innocent man! 
 Poor child! 
 You're shivering. 
 The poorest little wretch on God's earth--locked up--for me! A little wild animal, locked up. There he goes, up and down, up and down--in his cage--don't you see him?--looking for a place to gnaw his way through--little grey rat. [He gets up and roams about.] 
 There, there! [He kisses her closed eyes.] 
 Sleep? 
 [With a movement to free 'himself] To the edge of the world-and over! 
 [With a laugh] Ah! Let's be happy and shut out the sight of him. Who cares? Millions suffer for no mortal reason. Let's be strong, like Keith. No! I won't leave you, Wanda. Let's forget everything except ourselves. [Suddenly] There he goes-up and down! 
 [Whispering] Pray for us! Bravo! Pray away! [Suddenly the girl stretches out her arms and lifts her face  with a look of ecstasy.] What? 
 [Bending down over her] Poor child! When we die, Wanda, let's go together. We should keep each other warm out in the dark. 
 Keith! So you've seen? 
 [Calmly] Still looking after your honour, KEITH! 
 Sorry, old man. 
 I give it. 
 [With a smile] I swear. 
 [Softly] Good luck, brother. KEITH goes out. 
 Supper, child--I've had nothing all day. Put these lilies in water. [She takes the lilies and obediently puts them into a vase.  LARRY pours wine into a deep-coloured glass and drinks it off.] We've had a good time, Wanda. Best time I ever had, these last two months; and nothing but the bill to pay. 
 [Holding her away to look at her.] Take off those things and put on a bridal garment. 
 [In a choked voice] No pain, my pretty. 
 If you had seen him, as I have, all day, being tortured. Wanda,--we shall be out of it. [The wine mounting to his head] We shall be free in the dark; free of their cursed inhumanities. I hate this world--I loathe it! I hate its God-forsaken savagery; its pride and smugness! Keith's world--all righteous will-power and success. We're no good here, you and I--we were cast out at birth--soft, will-less--better dead. No fear, Keith! I'm staying indoors. [He pours wine into two glasses] Drink it up! [Obediently WANDA drinks, and he also.] Now go and make yourself beautiful. 
 [Touching her face and hair] Hanged by the neck until he's dead--for what I did. [WANDA takes a long look at his face, slips her arms from him,  and goes out through the curtains below the fireplace.] [LARRY feels in his pocket, brings out the little box, opens it,  fingers the white tabloids.] 
 Two each--after food. [He laughs and puts back the box] Oh! my girl! [The sound of a piano playing a faint festive tune is heard afar  off. He mutters, staring at the fire.] [Flames-flame, and flicker-ashes.] "No more, no more, the moon is dead, And all the people in it." [He sits on the couch with a piece of paper on his knees, adding  a few words with a stylo pen to what is already written.] [The GIRL, in a silk wrapper, coming back through the curtains,  watches him.] 
 [Looking up] It's all here--I've confessed. [Reading] "Please bury us together." "LAURENCE DARRANT. "January 28th, about six p.m." They'll find us in the morning. Come and have supper, my dear love. [The girl creeps forward. He rises, puts his arm round her, and  with her arm twined round him, smiling into each other's faces,  they go to the table and sit down.] The curtain falls for a few seconds to indicate the passage of  three hours. When it rises again, the lovers are lying on the  couch, in each other's arms, the lilies stream about them. The  girl's bare arm is round LARRY'S neck. Her eyes are closed; his  are open and sightless. There is no light but fire-light. A knocking on the door and the sound of a key turned in the  lock. KEITH enters. He stands a moment bewildered by the  half-light, then calls sharply: "Larry!" and turns up the light.  Seeing the forms on the couch, he recoils a moment. Then,  glancing at the table and empty decanters, goes up to the couch.
