 Mr Foreson? We'll do that lighting again. 
 
 Mr Foreson! 
 Mr Foreson. 
 For goodness sake, stand by! We'll do that lighting again. Check your floats. Great Scott! What the blazes! Mr Foreson! 
 Mr Foreson! Tell Miller to come down. Tell Herbert to sit in that chair. 
 Mr Foreson! Don't go off the stage. 
 
 Look! Once for all, what I want is the orchard in full moonlight, and the room dark except for the reading lamp. Cut off your front battens. 
 Mr Foreson! See this marked right. Now, come on with it! I want to get some beauty into this! 
 Now! 
 Great Scott! 
 On his face, on his face! 
 Yes. Now, mark that! My God! 
 
 Mr Foreson. Ask him if he's got that? Now pass to the change. Take your floats off altogether. Cut off that lamp. 
 Put a little amber in your back batten. Mark that! Now pass to the end. Mr Foreson! Black out Give us your first lighting-lamp on. And then the two changes. Quick as you can. Put some pep into it. Mr Foreson! Stand for me where Miss Hellgrove comes in. FORESON crosses to the window. No, no!--by the curtain. 
 Good! Leave it at that. We'll begin. Mr Foreson, send up to Mr Frust. 
 Mr Foreson. I want "Props." Is that boulder firm? It won't creak? Make that right. Let me see that lute. 
 
 That'll do, then. 
 
 Now, sir, we're all ready for rehearsal of "Orpheus with his Lute." It has charm. Well, sir, you'll see. George Fleetway. It's a very small part. Guy Toone plays the Professor; Vanessa Hellgrove his wife; Maude Hopkins the faun. They're not expensive, any of them. Miss Hellgrove's a find, I think. Quite. 
 No. 
 Look here, Mr FRUST, it's no use your expecting another "Pop goes the Weasel." Mr Foreson? Beginners. Take your curtain down. 
 Everybody on. 
 Give us some light. Fleetway. 
 
 Yes, yes. All right--you were splendid. He liked it. He quite - MISS H. 
 How wonderful Oh, Mr Vane, thank you! 
 
 
 That lighting's just right now, Miller. Got it marked carefully? Good. 
 Well, sir? So glad - Yes. 
 Why! Of course it's a little allegory. The tragedy of civilization--all real feeling for Beauty and Nature kept out, or pent up even in the cultured. Yes, he'd be all right, but - What! But this piece--I--I -! 
 But it'll break that girl's heart. I--really--I can't - Mr Frust, I--I beg. I've taken a lot of trouble with this little play. It's good. It's that girl's chance--and I - Mr Frost, the Public would take this, I'm sure they would; I'm convinced of it. You underrate them. But it--it moved you, sir; I saw it. I was watching. 
 Damnation! 
 "Punch and go!" That superstition! 
 Mr Foreson! This is scrapped. 
 Tell 'em to set the first act of "Louisa Loses," and put some pep into it.
