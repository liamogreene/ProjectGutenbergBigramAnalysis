I never met a Russian girl. About being lonely? Haven't you any Russian friends? Yes. I suppose all Russians do. What! Are you as badly on the rocks as that? I say, what's your name? You're a distrustful little soul; aren't you? Yes. I suppose you're bound to think us all brutes. We never know, unless it happens to be hand to hand; I haven't come in for that yet. Oh, glad?
