 
 Only I--Larry. 
 Yes, Keith. It's true. 
 
 It's true, I tell you; I've killed a man. Whom should I tell, Keith? I came to ask what I'm to do -- give myself up, or what? Last night. My head! Yes! It's like this, Keith--there's a girl - A Polish girl. She--her father died over here when she was sixteen, and left her all alone. There was a mongrel living in the same house who married her--or pretended to. She's very pretty, Keith. He left her with a baby coming. She lost it, and nearly starved. Then another fellow took her on, and she lived with him two years, till that brute turned up again and made her go back to him. He used to beat her black and blue. He'd left her again when--I met her. She was taking anybody then. 
 I never met a sweeter woman, or a truer, that I swear. Woman! She's only twenty now! When I went to her last night, that devil had found her out again. He came for me--a bullying, great, hulking brute. Look! 
 I took his ugly throat, and when I let go--
 
 Dead, Keith. I never knew till afterwards that she was hanging on to him--to h-help me. 
 We--we sat by it a long time. Then I carried it on my back down the street, round a corner, to an archway. About fifty yards. No. Three in the morning. Went back to her. She way lonely and afraid. So was I, Keith. Forty-two Borrow Square, Soho. Corner of Glove Lane. 
 If only I had, Keith! 
 
 This dropped out while we were struggling. 
 Yes. You must know what I ought to do. I didn't, mean to kill him, Keith. I love the girl--I love her. What shall I do? 
 Love!--That swinish brute! A million creatures die every day, and not one of them deserves death as he did. But but I feel it here. 
 Such an awful clutch, Keith. Help me if you can, old man. I may be no good, but I've never hurt a fly if I could help it. 
 It's a dark place, and dead night. About seven. To my rooms. Yes. Sat there--thinking. No. Never. No. No one. I don't know who should, Keith. No. She lives on the ground floor. I've got keys. 
 I can't be cut off from her! 
 Yes, a girl like that. Nothing. No. Nothing. I am. 
 Yes. Yes. I don't know. I was not drunk. A little claret--nothing! God knows. He hit me. 
 I didn't know I was so strong. She was scared for me. 
 Yes, Keith. 
 By God, you are a stony devil! Why not? 
 Oh, you lawyer! Were you never in a woman's arms? 
 So am I. I tell you she's devoted. Did you ever pick up a lost dog? Well, she has the lost dog's love for me. And I for her; we picked each other up. I've never felt for another woman what I feel for her--she's been the saving of me! It was the first dark place. Don't! Yes. No. 
 I'm not made of iron, like you. Why not? If you had done it -! 
 I don't know. In Pimlico, I think. Nearly a year. Till she met me. 
 Keith! 
 Yes. I think so. I've never heard. KEITH turns away and walks up and down; then, stopping at LARRY's chair, he speaks. I promise. 
 "Unstable as water, he shall not excel!" Very little. 
 You're very good, Keith; you've always been very good to me--I don't know why. 
 I'd better have done with it. KErra. You fool! Give that to me. 
 No. 
 White magic, Keith! Just one--and they may do what they like to you, and you won't know it. Snap your fingers at all the tortures. It's a great comfort! Have one to keep by you? 
 Not quite! You've never killed a man, you see. 
 D'you remember that hammer when we were boys and you riled me, up in the long room? I had luck then. I had luck in Naples once. I nearly killed a driver for beating his poor brute of a horse. But now--! My God! 
 KEITH touched, goes up and lays a hand on his shoulder. All right, Keith; I'll try. 
 Don't keep me longer than you can help, Keith. Keith! I've been waiting in for you all day. I couldn't stand it any longer. Well, what's the sentence, brother? Transportation for life and then to be fined forty pounds'? Must. 
 Together, Keith? Swear? What? I've seen nothing, not even a paper. With murder? What was he like, Keith? What! 
 Why, I saw him--after I left you last night. By the archway. It draws you, Keith. KErra. You're mad, I think. I talked to him, and he said, "Thank you for this little chat. It's worth more than money when you're down." Little grey man like a shaggy animal. And a newspaper boy came up and said: "That's right, guv'nors! 'Ere's where they found the body--very spot. They 'yn't got 'im yet." 
 An innocent man! 
 In the sun! "A cup of wine and thou." 
 How can I, Keith? I must see how it goes with that poor devil. Not? 
 Shall we, Wanda? 
 Take them back, Keith. It won't do, Keith. I must see it out. I've still got some kind of honour. If I clear out before I know, I shall have none--nor peace. Take them, Keith, or I'll put them in the fire. 
 I'm awfully sorry, Keith; awfully sorry, old man. I know. I'll do nothing without you, Keith. You can trust me. I swear. Good night! KEITH goes. LARRY Sits down on the couch sand stares at the fire. The girl steals up and slips her arms about him. An innocent man! Poor child! You're shivering. The poorest little wretch on God's earth--locked up--for me! A little wild animal, locked up. There he goes, up and down, up and down--in his cage--don't you see him?--looking for a place to gnaw his way through--little grey rat. 
 There, there! 
 Sleep? 
 To the edge of the world-and over! 
 Ah! Let's be happy and shut out the sight of him. Who cares? Millions suffer for no mortal reason. Let's be strong, like Keith. No! I won't leave you, Wanda. Let's forget everything except ourselves. 
 There he goes-up and down! 
 Pray for us! Bravo! Pray away! 
 What? 
 Poor child! When we die, Wanda, let's go together. We should keep each other warm out in the dark. Keith! So you've seen? 
 Still looking after your honour, KEITH! Sorry, old man. I give it. 
 I swear. 
 Good luck, brother. KEITH goes out. Supper, child--I've had nothing all day. Put these lilies in water. 
 We've had a good time, Wanda. Best time I ever had, these last two months; and nothing but the bill to pay. 
 Take off those things and put on a bridal garment. 
 No pain, my pretty. If you had seen him, as I have, all day, being tortured. Wanda,--we shall be out of it. 
 We shall be free in the dark; free of their cursed inhumanities. I hate this world--I loathe it! I hate its God-forsaken savagery; its pride and smugness! Keith's world--all righteous will-power and success. We're no good here, you and I--we were cast out at birth--soft, will-less--better dead. No fear, Keith! I'm staying indoors. 
 Drink it up! 
 Now go and make yourself beautiful. 
 Hanged by the neck until he's dead--for what I did. 
 
 Two each--after food. 
 Oh! my girl! 
 
 "No more, no more, the moon is dead, And all the people in it." 
 
 
 It's all here--I've confessed. 
 "Please bury us together." "LAURENCE DARRANT. "January 28th, about six p.m." They'll find us in the morning. Come and have supper, my dear love. 
 The curtain falls for a few seconds to indicate the passage of three hours. When it rises again, the lovers are lying on the couch, in each other's arms, the lilies stream about them. The girl's bare arm is round LARRY'S neck. Her eyes are closed; his are open and sightless. There is no light but fire-light. A knocking on the door and the sound of a key turned in the lock. KEITH enters. He stands a moment bewildered by the half-light, then calls sharply: "Larry!" and turns up the light. Seeing the forms on the couch, he recoils a moment. Then, glancing at the table and empty decanters, goes up to the couch.
