 You are not a common clergyman: you are an archdeacon. 
 Oh really, father! Miss! Is that the way to talk to a widow? 
 I wanted to; and you wouldn't let me. You insisted on my marrying Roosenhonkers-Pipstein. 
 How did you know he was a millionaire? 
 His solicitors proved to me that he had sixteen millions when he died. He was a millionaire to the last. 
 The speculative ones were not paid up; and the gilt-edged ones just paid the calls on them until the whole show burst up. 
 Oh bother! If you had lost ten thousand a year what expressions would you use, do you think? The long and the short of it is that I can't live in the squalid way you are accustomed to. 
 I have formed habits of comfort. 
 Well, elegance if you like. Luxury, if you insist. Call it what you please. A house that costs less than a hundred thousand dollars a year to run is intolerable to me. 
 That's an idea. I will. [She vanishes through the curtains.] 
 No, thank you, Your Highness. I am only a lady's maid. I understood you wanted one. 
 Certainly I do, Your Highness. Nothing could be more correct. Saving and self-denial both at once; and an act of kindness to me, as I am out of place. 
 The war, Your Highness, the war. 
[taking out her handkerchief and showing signs of grief] My poor mistress -- 
[mastering her emotion and smiling through her tears] Your Highness is too good. 
[gushing] Oh, I know--I shall. 
 The first time of what, Your Highness? 
 About what, Your Highness? 
. Then he was at the ball too, Your Highness? 
 A lady's maid has to be, Your Highness. [She produces some letters.] Your Highness wishes to see my testimonials, no doubt. I have one from an Archdeacon. [She proffers the letters.] 
 No, Your Highness. They have daughters. I have first-rate testimonials from the Archdeacon and from his daughter. 
 May I regard myself as engaged then, Your Highness? 
 Naturally I think Your Highness ought to, most decidedly. 
 The same as the maid who went to the ball. Your Highness need not make any change. 
 I shall be quite content with what she began on; and I have no relatives dependent on me. And I am willing to wear my own dresses at balls. 
 If he does, Your Highness, ask him to speak to me about it. I shall regard it as part of my duties to speak to your uncle about matters of business. 
 May I regard myself as engaged, Your Highness? I should like to set about my duties immediately. 
[raising the cover from the tea cake and looking at it] How long has that been standing at the top of the stairs? 
 Send the manager here. 
 He will tell you when I have done with him. How dare you treat Her Highness in this disgraceful manner? What sort of pothouse is this? Where did you learn to speak to persons of quality? Take away your cold tea and cold cake instantly. Give them to the chambermaid you were flirting with whilst Her Highness was waiting. Order some fresh tea at once; and do not presume to bring it yourself: have it brought by a civil waiter who is accustomed to wait on ladies, and not, like you, on commercial travellers. 
[sternly] Sit down, madam. [The Princess sits down forlornly. Ermyntrude turns imperiously to the Manager.] Her Highness will require this room for twenty minutes. 
 Yes: it will take fully that time to find a proper apartment in a respectable hotel. 
 You understand perfectly. How dare you offer Her Highness a room on the second floor? 
 Well? at least? 
 Don't you dare tell Her Highness a falsehood. It is not occupied. You are saving it up for the arrival of the five-fifteen express, from which you hope to pick up some fat armaments contractor who will drink all the bad champagne in your cellar at 5 francs a bottle, and pay twice over for everything because he is in the same hotel with Her Highness, and can boast of having turned her out of the best rooms. 
 And you take advantage of Her Highness's graciousness. You impose on her with your stories. You give her a room not fit for a dog. You send cold tea to her by a decayed professional person disguised as a waiter. But don't think you can trifle with me. I am a lady's maid; and I know the ladies' maids and valets of all the aristocracies of Europe and all the millionaires of America. When I expose your hotel as the second-rate little hole it is, not a soul above the rank of a curate with a large family will be seen entering it. I shake its dust off my feet. Order the luggage to be taken down at once. 
 Is Your Highness dissatisfied with me? 
[to the manager] You hear. Perhaps you think Her Highness is going to do the work of teaching you your place herself, instead of leaving it to her maid. 
[interrupting] There! Her Highness forgives you; but don't do it again. Now go downstairs, my good man, and get that suite on the first floor ready for us. And send some proper tea. And turn on the heating apparatus until the temperature in the rooms is comfortably warm. And have hot water put in all the bedrooms -- 
[scornfully] Yes: there WOULD be. Suppose we must put up with that: sinks in our rooms, and pipes that rattle and bang and guggle all over the house whenever anyone washes his hands. I know. 
 No harder than other people. But when I'm not pleased I'm not too ladylike to say so. That's all the difference. There is nothing more, thank you. The Manager shrugs his shoulders resignedly; makes a deep bow to the Princess; goes to the door; wafts a kiss surreptitiously to Ermyntrude; and goes out. 
 In Your Highness's service I know no fear. Your Highness can leave all unpleasant people to me. 
 Dare I ask what it is, Your Highness? 
 Indeed? Which son? 
 Still, a husband is a husband. I wish I had one. 
 Your Highness is provided for. I'm not. 
 I shall not say so again, Your Highness, except perhaps to the man. 
 I am a widow, Your Highness. 
 Duval! Nonsense! The usual thing. It is the Inca himself, incognito. 
 Leave him to me, Your Highness. 
 I am an Englishwoman, Your Highness, and perfectly capable of tackling ten Incas if necessary. I will arrange the matter. [To the Manager.] Show Her Highness to her bedroom; and then show Captain Duval in here. 
[moving haughtily and carelessly to the table] I hadn't the slightest intention of treating you with ceremony. [She sits down: a liberty which gives him a perceptible shock.] I am quite at a loss to imagine why I should treat a perfect stranger named Duval: a captain! almost a subaltern! with the smallest ceremony. 
 It doesn't matter. You may sit down. 
 I said, you...may...sit...down. 
 What is your business? 
 The Allerhochst? 
 I wonder does he feel ridiculous when people call him the Allerhochst. 
 Is he nice looking? 
 They say he takes himself very seriously. 
 How cheerful! Can he laugh? 
[frigidly] I asked could the Inca laugh. I did not ask could you laugh. 
 You intimated that you had some business? 
[staring at the contents] What awful taste he must have! I can't wear that. 
 Miniature! It must be bigger than the original. My good man, you don't expect me to wear this round my neck: it's as big as a turtle. [He shuts the case with an angry snap.] How much did it cost? 
 Give it to me [she snatches it] I'll pawn it and buy something nice with the money. 
 So much the better. The Inca will have to redeem it to save himself from that disgrace; and the poor pawnbroker will get his money back. Nobody would buy it, you know. 
 Well, look at it! Just look at it! I ask you! 
[rising and retreating behind her chair with the brooch] Here! you let that brooch alone. You presented it to me on behalf of the Inca. It is mine. You said my appearance was satisfactory. 
[calmly sitting down and replacing the case on the table] How could he? There would be no clergyman to marry us. It would have to be quite morganatic. 
 When I marry the Inca's son, Captain, I shall make the Inca order you to cut off that moustache. It is too irresistible. Doesn't it fascinate everyone in Perusalem? 
 What I like about you, Captain Duval, is your modesty. 
[indignant] Well! 
 You know, if I had a moustache like that, it would turn my head. I should go mad. Are you quite sure the Inca isn't mad? 
 Then I am a lunatic because I don't like that ridiculous brooch. 
 Thank you. 
 MY Inca! Oh, come! I like that. He is not my Inca yet. 
 Well, he started it, you know. 
 He had only talked. 
 Captain Duval, I don't want to be unsympathetic; but suppose we get back to business. 
 Well, MY business. You want me to marry one of the Inca's sons: I forget which. 
[interrupting] Oh, please, please, mayn't I have one with a shorter name? What is he called at home? 
 Are they all as clever and charming as their father? 
 Quite a large choice, eh? 
 If! What is this? I never wanted to marry one of them. I thought you wanted me to. 
 Oh, Captain, how could a humble person like myself be of any interest to a prince who is surrounded with the ablest and most far-reaching intellects in the world? 
 Oh, how can you say that! There is Admiral von Cockpits -- 
 But General Von Schinkenburg -- 
 Fortunately not, Captain. I'd rather marry Chips. 
 Why? 
 Well, what about Snooks? 
 But hasn't any of them inherited the family genius? Surely, if Providence has entrusted them with the care of Perusalem--if they are all descended from Bedrock the Great -- 
[shocked] Oh, Captain! Take care! Incadisparagement. 
 My experience is that the relatives of men of genius are always the greatest duffers imaginable. 
 But bless my soul, Captain, if all the Inca's generals are incapables, and all his relatives duffers, Perusalem will be beaten in the war; and then it will become a republic, like France after 1871, and the Inca will be sent to St Helena. 
 What! 
 I give it up. 
 Then goodbye to the Inca. 
 But won't that be a come-down for him? Think of it! after being Inca, to be a mere President! 
 What! You too worship before the statue of Liberty, like the Americans? 
[laughing] Oh! You'd better not let them hear you say that, Captain. 
 Whatever on earth can you be going to tell me, Captain? 
 You are the Inca in disguise. 
 How could I help divining it, Sir? Who is there in the world like you? Your magnetism -- 
 Oh, Sir, you are married. 
 This is really charming of you. But the time has come for me to make a revelation. It is your Imperial Majesty's turn now to brace yourself. To steel yourself. I am not the princess. I am -- 
 You knew all along! 
 How clever of you, Sir! But you cannot afford to marry me. 
 You are too poor. You have to eat war bread. Kings nowadays belong to the poorer classes. The King of England does not even allow himself wine at dinner. 
 You may laugh, Sir; but I really could not live in that style. I am the widow of a millionaire, ruined by your little war. 
 Excuse me: mine was a hyphenated millionaire. 
[revolted, sinking into his chair] I think it quite the worst pun I ever heard. 
 The sooner the better, Sir. Many fine young men are dying while you wait. 
 Because you make them. 
 Sir! [She curtsies.] 
 There is. Shall I fetch her? 
 About the usual thing. 
 I am afraid the explanation will fall rather flat without your magnetism. 
[seriously] Yes, it is fair. What other defence have we poor common people against your shining armor, your mailed fist, your pomp and parade, your terrible power over us? Are these things fair? 
[eagerly] Ratherrrrrr. I shall be delighted. 
 Don't be afraid. I promise to refuse any incorrect proposals.
