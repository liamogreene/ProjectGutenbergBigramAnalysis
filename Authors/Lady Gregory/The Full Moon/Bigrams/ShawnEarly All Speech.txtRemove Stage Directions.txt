 It is likely the train will not be up to its time, and cattle being on it for the fair. It's best wait in the shed. Is that BartleyFallon? What way are you, Bartley? Is it business with the nine o'clock you have? It is not long till the full moon will be rising. Ah, what could happen any person in the street of Cloon? I thought you might be sending something to the fair. They are saying there'll be good demand at the fair of Carrow to-morrow. Are you forgetting, Mr. Halvey, that you are to meet his Reverence on the platform that is coming home from drinking water at the Spa?

 Give out now, Davideen, a verse of "The Heather Broom." That's a splendid tune.

. Oh, let you not endanger yourself! It is the peelers should go follow him, that are armed with their batons and their guns. He is, and queer in the mind. Take care did he get a bite from the dog, that left some venom working in his blood. I was not nearer, or as near as what Mrs.Broderick was. 
 Oh! stop him and keep a hold of him, Mr. Halvey! There is a surer way than that.
