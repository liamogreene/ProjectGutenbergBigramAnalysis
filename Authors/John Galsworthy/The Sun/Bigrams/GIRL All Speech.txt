 God knows what 'e'll say, Jim. 
 He couldn't come before. I'm frightened. 'E was fond o' me. 
 I ought to 'a waited, Jim; with 'im in the fightin'. 
 [Touching him] Ah! 
 Not like you, Jim--not like you. 
 I promised him. 
 I ought to 'a waited. I never thought he'd come back from the fightin'. 
 [Looking back along the tow-path] What'll he be like, I wonder? 
 I never could. 
 I'd rather have it off me mind, with him home. 
 What's the time, Jim? 
 [Looking along the towing-path] He said four o'clock. Jim, you better go. 
 [Dully] I dunno, just. I've not seen him these three years. I dunno no more, since I've known you. 
 'Bout your size. Oh! Jim, go along! 
 Jim, do you love me true? [For answer MAN takes her avidly in his arms.] I ain't ashamed--I ain't ashamed. If 'e could see me 'eart. 
 Jim, don't lift your hand to 'im! Promise! 
 Promise! 
 [With a shiver] Nor p'raps he isn't. 
 God 'elp us! 
 P'raps he'll say that too. 
 I'm frightened: 
 [Seizing his hand] Oh, no! Give it to me, Jim! 
 [Softly] Jim, you won't go fightin' in the sun, with the birds all callin'? 
 And I love you, Jim. I don't want nothin' more than you in all the world. 
 It's him! 
 Hallo, Jack! [Softly] I got things to tell you! 
 You been so long. 
 [Drawing back] No. 
 My man. 
 [Pleading] Jim! 
 [Covering her face] Oh! Him! 
 Jack, don't think too 'ard of me!
