 Mr Foreson? 
 We'll do that lighting again. [FORESON walks straight of the Stage into the wings Right.] [A pause.] Mr Foreson! [Crescendo] Mr Foreson. [FORESON walks on again from Right and shades his eyes.] 
 For goodness sake, stand by! We'll do that lighting again. Check your floats. 
 Great Scott! What the blazes! Mr Foreson! [FORESON walks straight out into the wings Left. Crescendo.] Mr Foreson! 
 Tell Miller to come down. 
 Tell Herbert to sit in that chair. [FORESON walks straight out into the Right wings.] Mr Foreson! 
 Don't go off the stage. [FORESON mutters.] [ELECTRICS appears from the wings, Stage Left. He is a dark,  thin-faced man with rather spikey hair.] 
 Look! 
 Once for all, what I want is the orchard in full moonlight, and the room dark except for the reading lamp. Cut off your front battens. [ELECTRICS withdraws Left. FORESON walks off the Stage into the  Right wings.] Mr Foreson! 
 See this marked right. Now, come on with it! I want to get some beauty into this! [While he is speaking, HERBERT, the call boy, appears from the  wings Right, a mercurial youth of about sixteen with a wide  mouth.] 
 Now! [All the lights go out. In a wail] Great Scott! [A throaty chuckle from FORESON in the darkness. The light  dances up, flickers, shifts, grows steady, falling on the  orchard outside. The reading lamp darts alight and a piercing  little glare from it strikes into the auditorium away from  
 Look--at--that--shade! [FORESON mutters, walks up to it and turns it round so that the  light shines on HERBERT'S legs.] On his face, on his face! [FORESON turns the light accordingly.] 
 Yes. Now, mark that! 
 My God! [The blue suddenly becomes amber.] [The blue returns. All is steady. HERBERT is seen diverting  himself with an imaginary cigar.] Mr Foreson. 
 Ask him if he's got that? 
 Now pass to the change. Take your floats off altogether. 
 Cut off that lamp. [The lamp goes out] Put a little amber in your back batten. Mark that! Now pass to the end. Mr Foreson! 
 Black out 
 Give us your first lighting-lamp on. And then the two changes. Quick as you can.  Put some pep into it. Mr Foreson! 
 Stand for me where Miss Hellgrove comes in. FORESON crosses to the window. No, no!--by the curtain. [FORESON takes his stand by the curtain; and suddenly the three  lighting effects are rendered quickly and with miraculous  exactness.] Good! Leave it at that. We'll begin. Mr Foreson, send up to Mr Frust. [He moves from the auditorium and ascends on to the Stage, by  some steps Stage Right.] 
 Mr Foreson. 
 I want "Props." 
 Is that boulder firm? 
 It won't creak? 
 Make that right. Let me see that lute. [PROPS produces a property lute. While they scrutinize it, a  broad man with broad leathery clean-shaven face and small mouth,  occupied by the butt end of a cigar, has come on to the stage  from Stage Left, and stands waiting to be noticed.] 
 [Turning to "PROPS"] That'll do, then. ["PROPS" goes out through the French windows.] 
 [To FRUST] Now, sir, we're all ready for rehearsal of "Orpheus with his Lute." 
 It has charm. 
 Well, sir, you'll see. 
 George Fleetway. 
 It's a very small part. 
 Guy Toone plays the Professor; Vanessa Hellgrove his wife; Maude Hopkins the faun. 
 They're not expensive, any of them. Miss Hellgrove's a find, I think. 
 Quite. 
 [Doubtfully] No. [With resolution] Look here, Mr FRUST, it's no use your expecting another "Pop goes the Weasel." 
 Mr Foreson? 
 Beginners. Take your curtain down. [He descends the steps and seats himself next to 
 Vanessa Hellgrove. 
 Take up the curtain. Mr Foreson? [The curtain goes up.] 
 Everybody on. [He and FRUST leave their seats and ascend on to the Stage, on  which are collecting the four Players.] 
 Give us some light. 
 Fleetway. [FLEETWAY comes up.] 
 [Pleased and happy] Yes, yes. All right--you were splendid. He liked it. He quite - MISS H. [Clasping her hand] How wonderful Oh, Mr Vane, thank you! [She clasps his hands; but suddenly, seeing that FRUST is coming  back, fits across into the curtain and vanishes.] [The Stage, in the crude light, as empty now save for FRUST,  who, in the French windows, Centre, is mumbling his cigar; and  VANE, Stage Right, who is looking up into the wings, Stage  Left.] 
 [Calling up] That lighting's just right now, Miller. Got it marked carefully? 
 Good. [To FRUST who as coming down] Well, sir? So glad - 
 Yes. 
 [A little staggered] Why! Of course it's a little allegory. The tragedy of civilization--all real feeling for Beauty and Nature kept out, or pent up even in the cultured. 
 Yes, he'd be all right, but - 
 What! But this piece--I--I -! 
 [Distressed] But it'll break that girl's heart. I--really--I can't - 
 Mr Frust, I--I beg. I've taken a lot of trouble with this little play. It's good. It's that girl's chance--and I - 
 Mr Frost, the Public would take this, I'm sure they would; I'm convinced of it. You underrate them. 
 But it--it moved you, sir; I saw it. I was watching. 
 [Dashing his hands through his hair till it stands up] Damnation! [FORESON walks on from the wings, Right.] 
 "Punch and go!" That superstition! [FORESON walks straight out into the wings, Left.] 
 Mr Foreson! 
 This is scrapped. [With savagery] Tell 'em to set the first act of "Louisa Loses," and put some pep into it. [He goes out through the French windows with the wind still in  his hair.]
