   A Girl, sits crouched over her knees on a stile close to a
     river.  A MAN with a silver badge stands beside her, clutching
     the worn top plank.  GIRL'S level brows are drawn together;
     her eyes see her memories.  MAN's eyes see GIRL; he has
     a dark, twisted face.  The bright sun shines; the quiet river
     flows; the Cuckoo is calling; the mayflower is in bloom along
     the hedge that ends in the stile on the towing-path.

GIRL.  God knows what 'e'll say, Jim.

MAN.  Let 'im.  'E's come too late, that's all.

GIRL.  He couldn't come before.  I'm frightened.  'E was fond o'
me.

MAN.  And aren't I fond of you?

GIRL.  I ought to 'a waited, Jim; with 'im in the fightin'.

MAN.  [Passionately]  And what about me?  Aren't I been in the
fightin'--earned all I could get?

GIRL.  [Touching him]  Ah!

MAN.  Did you--?  [He cannot speak the words.]

GIRL.  Not like you, Jim--not like you.

MAN.  Have a spirit, then.

GIRL.  I promised him.

MAN.  One man's luck's another's poison.

GIRL.  I ought to 'a waited.  I never thought he'd come back from
the fightin'.

MAN.  [Grimly]  Maybe 'e'd better not 'ave.

GIRL.  [Looking back along the tow-path]  What'll he be like, I
wonder?

MAN.  [Gripping her shoulder]  Daisy, don't you never go back on
me, or I should kill you, and 'im too.

     [GIRL looks at him, shivers, and puts her lips to his.]

GIRL.  I never could.

MAN.  Will you run for it?  'E'd never find us!

     [GIRL shakes her head.]

MAN [Dully]  What's the good o' stayin'?  The world's wide.

GIRL.  I'd rather have it off me mind, with him home.

MAN.  [Clenching his hands]  It's temptin' Providence.

GIRL.  What's the time, Jim?

MAN.  [Glancing at the sun]  'Alf past four.

GIRL.  [Looking along the towing-path]  He said four o'clock.
Jim, you better go.

MAN.  Not I.  I've not got the wind up.  I've seen as much of
hell as he has, any day.  What like is he?

GIRL.  [Dully]  I dunno, just.  I've not seen him these three
years.  I dunno no more, since I've known you.

MAN.  Big or little chap?

GIRL.  'Bout your size.  Oh! Jim, go along!

MAN.  No fear!  What's a blighter like that to old Fritz's
shells?  We didn't shift when they was comin'.  If you'll go, I'll
go; not else.

     [Again she shakes her head.]

GIRL.  Jim, do you love me true?

     [For answer MAN takes her avidly in his arms.]

I ain't ashamed--I ain't ashamed.  If 'e could see me 'eart.

MAN.  Daisy!  If I'd known you out there, I never could 'a stuck
it.  They'd 'a got me for a deserter.  That's how I love you!

GIRL.  Jim, don't lift your hand to 'im!  Promise!

MAN.  That's according.

GIRL.  Promise!

MAN.  If 'e keeps quiet, I won't.  But I'm not accountable--not
always, I tell you straight--not since I've been through that.

GIRL.  [With a shiver]  Nor p'raps he isn't.

MAN.  Like as not.  It takes the lynch pins out, I tell you.

GIRL.  God 'elp us!

MAN.  [Grimly]  Ah!  We said that a bit too often.  What we want
we take, now; there's no one else to give it us, and there's no
fear'll stop us; we seen the bottom of things.

GIRL.  P'raps he'll say that too.

MAN.  Then it'll be 'im or me.

GIRL.  I'm frightened:

MAN.  [Tenderly]  No, Daisy, no!  The river's handy.  One more or
less.  'E shan't 'arm you; nor me neither.  [He takes out a knife.]

GIRL.  [Seizing his hand]  Oh, no!  Give it to me, Jim!

MAN.  [Smiling]  No fear!  [He puts it away]  Shan't 'ave no need
for it like as not.  All right, little Daisy; you can't be expected
to see things like what we do.  What's life, anyway?  I've seen a
thousand lives taken in five minutes.  I've seen dead men on the
wires like flies on a flypaper.  I've been as good as dead meself a
hundred times.  I've killed a dozen men.  It's nothin'.  He's safe,
if 'e don't get my blood up.  If he does, nobody's safe; not 'im, nor
anybody else; not even you.  I'm speakin' sober.

GIRL.  [Softly]  Jim, you won't go fightin' in the sun, with the
birds all callin'?

MAN.  That depends on 'im.  I'm not lookin' for it.  Daisy, I
love you.  I love your hair.  I love your eyes.  I love you.

GIRL.  And I love you, Jim.  I don't want nothin' more than you
in all the world.

MAN.  Amen to that, my dear.  Kiss me close!

     The sound of a voice singing breaks in on their embrace.  THE
     GIRL starts from his arms, and looks behind her along the
     towing-path.  MAN draws back against, the hedge, fingering
     his side, where the knife is hidden.  The song comes nearer.


                   "I'll be right there to-night,
                    Where the fields are snowy white;
                    Banjos ringing, darkies singing,
                    All the world seems bright."

GIRL.  It's him!

MAN.  Don't get the wind up, Daisy.  I'm here!

     [The singing stops.  A man's voice says "Christ!  It's Daisy;
     it's little Daisy 'erself!"  GIRL stands rigid.  The figure
     of a soldier appears on the other side of the stile.  His cap is
     tucked into his belt, his hair is bright in the sunshine; he is
     lean, wasted, brown, and laughing.]

SOLDIER.  Daisy!  Daisy!  Hallo, old pretty girl!

     [GIRL does not move, barring the way, as it were.]

GIRL.  Hallo, Jack! [Softly]  I got things to tell you!

SOLDIER.  What sort o' things, this lovely day?  Why, I got things
that'd take me years to tell.  Have you missed me, Daisy?

GIRL.  You been so long.

SOLDIER.  So I 'ave.  My Gawd!  It's a way they 'ave in the Army.  I
said when I got out of it I'd laugh.  Like as the sun itself I used
to think of you, Daisy, when the trumps was comin' over, and the wind
was up.  D'you remember that last night in the wood?  "Come back and
marry me quick, Jack."  Well, here I am--got me pass to heaven.  No
more fightin', no more drillin', no more sleepin' rough.  We can get
married now, Daisy.  We can live soft an' 'appy.  Give us a kiss, my
dear.

GIRL.  [Drawing back]  No.

SOLDIER.  [Blankly]  Why not?

     [MAN, with a swift movement steps along the hedge to THE
     GIRL'S side.]

MAN.  That's why, soldier.

SOLDIER.  [Leaping over the stile]  'Oo are you, Pompey?  The sun
don't shine in your inside, do it?  'Oo is he, Daisy?

GIRL.  My man.

SOLDIER.  Your-man!  Lummy!  "Taffy was a Welshman, Taffy was a
thief!"  Well, mate!  So you've been through it, too.  I'm laughin'
this mornin' as luck will 'ave it.  Ah!  I can see your knife.

MAN.  [Who has half drawn his knife]  Don't laugh at me, I tell
you.

SOLDIER.  Not at you, not at you.  [He looks from one to the other]
I'm laughin' at things in general.  Where did you get it, mate?

MAN.  [Watchfully]  Through the lung.

SOLDIER.  Think o' that!  An' I never was touched.  Four years an'
never was touched.  An' so you've come an' took my girl!  Nothin'
doin'!  Ha!  [Again he looks from one to the other-then away]  Well!
The world's before me!  [He laughs]  I'll give you Daisy for a lung
protector.

MAN.  [Fiercely]  You won't.  I've took her.

SOLDIER.  That's all right, then.  You keep 'er.  I've got a laugh in
me you can't put out, black as you look!  Good-bye, little Daisy!

     [GIRL makes a movement towards him.]

MAN.  Don't touch 'im!

     [GIRL stands hesitating, and suddenly bursts into tears.]

SOLDIER.  Look 'ere, mate; shake 'ands!  I don't want to see a girl
cry, this day of all, with the sun shinin'.  I seen too much of
sorrer.  You and me've been at the back of it.  We've 'ad our whack.
Shake!

MAN.  Who are you kiddin'?  You never loved 'er!

SOLDIER.  [After a long moment's pause]  Oh!  I thought I did.

MAN.  I'll fight you for her.

     [He drops his knife. ]

SOLDIER.  [Slowly]  Mate, you done your bit, an' I done mine.  It's
took us two ways, seemin'ly.

GIRL.  [Pleading]  Jim!

MAN.  [With clenched fists]  I don't want 'is charity.  I only
want what I can take.

SOLDIER.  Daisy, which of us will you 'ave?

GIRL.  [Covering her face]  Oh!  Him!

SOLDIER.  You see, mate!  Put your 'ands down.  There's nothin' for
it but a laugh.  You an' me know that.  Laugh, mate!

MAN.  You blarsted----!

     [GIRL springs to him and stops his mouth.]

SOLDIER.  It's no use, mate.  I can't do it.  I said I'd laugh
to-day, and laugh I will.  I've come through that, an' all the stink
of it; I've come through sorrer.  Never again!  Cheerio, mate!  The
sun's a-shinin'!  He turns away.

GIRL.  Jack, don't think too 'ard of me!

SOLDIER.  [Looking back]  No fear, my dear!  Enjoy your fancy!  So
long!  Gawd bless you both!

He sings, and goes along the path, and the song fades away.

              "I'll be right there to-night
               Where the fields are snowy white;
               Banjos ringing, darkies singing
               All the world seems bright!"



MAN.  'E's mad!

GIRL. [Looking down the path with her hands clasped]  The sun has
touched 'im, Jim!
