 How do, Lady Ella? How do, Squire?--how do, Rector? 
 How de do? This the beastie? I see. Quite! Who'll hold him for me? Right as rain! She held him like an angel--he just licked her, and never made a sound. Better leave 'em a minute. She's moppin' 'im off. 
 Wonderful clever hands! 
 Who? Well--there you have me! All I know is she's a first-rate nurse--been helpin' me with a case in Ditch Lane. Nice woman, too--thorough good sort! Quite an acquisition here. H'm! 
 Excuse me hurryin' off--very late. Good-bye, Rector. Good-bye, Lady Ella. Good-bye!
