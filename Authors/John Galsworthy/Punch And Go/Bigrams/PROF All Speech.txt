 "Orpheus symbolized the voice of Beauty, the call of life, luring us mortals with his song back from the graves we dig for ourselves. Probably the ancients realized this neither more nor less than we moderns. Mankind has not changed. The civilized being still hides the faun and the dryad within its broadcloth and its silk. And yet"--[He stops, with a dried-up air-rather impatiently] Go on, my dear! It helps the atmosphere. [The voice of his WIFE begins again, gets as far as "made them  sing" and stops dead, just as the PROFESSOR's pen is beginning  to scratch. And suddenly, drawing the curtain further aside] [SHE appears. Much younger than the PROFESSOR, pale, very  pretty, of a Botticellian type in face, figure, and in her  clinging cream-coloured frock. She gazes at her abstracted  husband; then swiftly moves to the lintel of the open window,  and stands looking out.] 
 [Looking Up] Umm? 
 Aha! 
 What? 
 Yes; I heard. I'm sorry. I get absorbed. 
 [Startled] My dear, your song was helping me like anything to get the mood. This paper is the very deuce--to balance between the historical and the natural. 
 [Grumbling] Umm! Wish I thought that! Modern taste! History may go hang; they're all for tuppence-coloured sentiment nowadays. 
 I beg your pardon, my dear; I didn't catch. 
 That's what I'm, trying to say here. The Orpheus legend symbolizes to this day the call of Beauty! [He takes up his pen, while she continues to stare out at the moonlight. Yawning] Dash it! I get so sleepy; I wish you'd tell them to make the after-dinner coffee twice as strong. 
 How does this strike you? [Conning] "Many Renaissance pictures, especially those of Botticelli, Francesca and Piero di Cosimo were inspired by such legends as that of Orpheus, and we owe a tiny gem--like Raphael 'Apollo and Marsyas' to the same Pagan inspiration." 
 Quite. I might develop that: "We owe it our revolt against the academic; or our disgust at 'big business,' and all the grossness of commercial success. We owe -". [His voice peters out.] 
 [Abstracted] Eh! 
 [Rather startled] Possibly. But--er [With a dry smile] I mustn't say that here--hardly! 
 Most people think a lute is a sort of flute. [Yawning heavily] My dear, if you're not going to sing again, d'you mind sitting down? I want to concentrate. 
 Mind the dew! 
 [With a little dry laugh] Not bad! Not bad! The Christian virtues and the dew. [His hand takes up his pen, his face droops over his paper, while his wife looks at him with a very strange face] "How far we can trace the modern resurgence against the Christian virtues to the symbolic figures of Orpheus, Pan, Apollo, and Bacchus might be difficult to estimate, but -" [During those words his WIFE has passed through the window into  the moonlight, and her voice rises, singing as she goes:  "Orpheus with his lute, with his lute made trees..."] 
 [Suddenly aware of something] She'll get her throat bad. [He is silent as the voice swells in the distance] Sounds queer at night-H'm! [He is silent--Yawning. The voice dies away. Suddenly his head nods; he fights his drowsiness; writes a word or two, nods again, and in twenty seconds is asleep.] [The Stage is darkened by a black-out. FRUST's voice is heard  speaking.] 
 Phew! Beastly dream! Boof! H'm! [He moves to the window and calls.] Blanche! Blanche! [To himself] Made trees-made trees! [Calling] Blanche! WIFE's 
 Where are you? 
 I say--I I've been asleep--had a dream. Come in. I'll tell you. [She comes, and they stand in the window.] 
 I dreamed I saw a-faun on that boulder blowing on a pipe. [He looks nervously at the stone] With two damned little rabbits and a fox sitting up and listening. And then from out there came our friend Orpheus playing on his confounded lute, till he actually turned that tree there into you. And gradually he-he drew you like a snake till you--er--put your arms round his neck and--er--kissed him. Boof! I woke up. Most unpleasant. Why! Your hair's down! 
 Why? 
 What on earth? 
 Good heavens, Blanche, what's the matter with you to-night? 
 [Helplessly] My dear, I really don't know what you mean. 
 My dear, this is--this is--awful. [He tries to embrace her.] 
 I'm--I'm upset. I've never known you so--so - 
 [Soothingly] There, there! I'm sorry, darling; I really am. You're kipped--you're kipped. [He gives and she accepts a kiss] Better? [He gravitates towards his papers.] All right, now? 
 Well, I'll try and finish this to-night; then, to-morrow we might have a jaunt. How about a theatre? There's a thing--they say --called "Chinese Chops," that's been running years. 
 Very queer the power suggestion has over the mind. Very queer! There's nothing really in animism, you know, except the curious shapes rocks, trees and things take in certain lights--effect they have on our imagination. [He looks up] What's the matter now? 
 [Coming to himself and writing] "The Orpheus legend is the -- er--apotheosis of animism. Can we accept -" [His voice is lost in the sound of his WIFE'S voice beginning again: "Orpheus with his lute--with his lute made trees -" It dies in a sob. The PROFESSOR looks up startled, as the curtain falls]
