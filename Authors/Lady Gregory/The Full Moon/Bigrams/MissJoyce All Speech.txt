 _(At door, coming in backwards.)_ Go back now, go back! Don't be following after me in through the door! Is Mr. Halvey there? Don't let her come following me, Mr. Halvey!
 Cracked Mary it is, that is after coming back this day from the asylum.
 They had a right to keep her spancelled in the asylum. She would begrudge any respectable person to be walking the street. She'd hoot you, she'd shout you, she'd clap her hands at you. She is a blight in the town.
 It is likely she was well content in it, and the friends she had being of her own class.
 It was good shelter you got in it through the bad weather, and not to be out perishing under cold, the same as the starlings in the snow.
 It might be it was sent as a punishment before birth, for to show the power of God.
 It is not you, Mr. Halvey, will give in to an unruly thing like the moon, that is under no authority, and cannot be put back, the same as a fast day that would chance to fall upon a feast.
 _(To H.H.)_ It is a lantern for your own use it will be to-night, and his Reverence coming home through the street, and yourself coming along with him to the house. _Mrs.Broderick:_ That's right, MissJoyce. Keep a good grip of him. What do you say to him talking a while ago as if his mind was running on some thought to leave Cloon?
 What way could he leave it?
 I'll go set the table and kindle the fire, and I'll come back to meet the train with you myself. _(She goes. A noise heard outside.)_
 _(At door.)_ Are you there, HyacinthHalvey? The train is in. Come forward now, and give a welcome to his Reverence.
 You are near late as it is. The train is about to start.
 What at all has happened? Where is he gone? 
 He gave some sort of a bark or a howl. 
 Sure that was Tannian's own dog, that had a bit of meat snapped from Quirke's ass-car. He is without this door now. _(All look out.)_ He has the appearance of having a full meal taken.
