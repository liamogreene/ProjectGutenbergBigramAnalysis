 
 Bad dog! Bad dog! 
 Edward began it, Ella. 
 Bad dog! Bad dog! 
 
 Now! 
 
 He smells horrible. Bad dog--getting into ponds to fight! 
 Smell him, Bertie! 
 You might have that pond drained, Squire! 
 Bad dog! With Bertie's braces. It's all right; they're almost leather. 
 Quite. The fly's outside. Bertie, run and tell Jarvis to drive in for the Vet. Bertie! Catch him! 
 Yes. That'll do, Bertie. 
 I shall get hold of her for parish work. Yes. No. Gossip? What gossip? 
 How long have they been here, Jarvis? A trifle of a ring! Had she a wedding-ring on? 
 
 Bertie! My dear Ella! "What does it matter!" We've got to know. Somebody'll come. Yes, Bertie. I shouldn't. Ella! Quite safe, thanks to your strop. 
 Oh! There, he's broken it. Bertie! 
 Bertie, take Hannibal. 
 Look! Don't squeeze him, Bertie!
