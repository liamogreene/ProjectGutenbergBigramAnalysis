LADYELLA.  Don't bring Hannibal in till I know where she's put
Edward!

MAUD.  [Brutally, to HANNIBAL]  Bad dog!  Bad dog!

     [HANNIBAL snuffles.]

LADYELLA.  Maud, do take him out!  Tie him up.  Here!  [She takes
out a lace handkerchief ]  No--something stronger!  Poor darling
Edward!  [To HANNIBAL]  You are a bad dog!

     [HANNIBAL snuffles.]

MAUD.  Edward began it, Ella.  [To HANNIBAL]  Bad dog!  Bad dog!

     [HANNIBAL snuffles.]

LADYELLA.  Tie him up outside.  Here, take my scarf.  Where is my
poor treasure?  [She removes her scarf]  Catch!  His ear's torn; I
saw it.

MAUD.  [Taking the scarf, to HANNIBAL]  Now!

     [HANNIBAL snuffles.]

     [She ties the scarf to his collar]

He smells horrible.  Bad dog--getting into ponds to fight!

LADYELLA.  Tie him up, Maud.  I must try in here.

     [Their husbands, SQUIRE.and RECTOR, come hastening along
     the verandah.]

MAUD.  [To RECTOR]  Smell him, Bertie!  [To SQUIRE]  You
might have that pond drained, Squire!

     [She takes HANNIBAL out, and ties him to the verandah.  THE
     SQUIRE.and RECTOR Come in.  LADYELLA.is knocking on the door
     left.]

VOICE.  All right!  I've bound him up!

LADYELLA.  May I come in?

VOICE.  Just a second!  I've got nothing on.

     [LADYELLA.recoils.  SQUIRE.and RECTOR make an involuntary
     movement of approach.]

LADYELLA.  Oh!  There you are!

RECTOR.  [Doubtfully]  I was just going to wade in----

LADYELLA.  Hannibal would have killed him, if she hadn't rushed in!

SQUIRE.  Done him good, little beast!

LADYELLA.  Why didn't you go in, Tommy?

SQUIRE.  Well, I would--only she----

LADYELLA.  I can't think how she got Edward out of Hannibal's awful
mouth!

MAUD.  [Without--to HANNIBAL, who is snuffling on the verandah and
straining at the scarf]  Bad dog!

LADYELLA.  We must simply thank her tremendously!  I shall never
forget the way she ran in, with her skirts up to her waist!

SQUIRE.  By Jove!  No.  It was topping.

LADYELLA.  Her clothes must be ruined.  That pond--ugh! [She
wrinkles her nose]  Tommy, do have it drained.

RECTOR.  [Dreamily]  I don't remember her face in church.

SQUIRE.  Ah!  Yes.  Who is she?  Pretty woman!

LADYELLA.  I must get the Vet. to Edward.  [To SQUIRE]  Tommy,
do exert yourself!

     [MAUD re-enters.]

SQUIRE.  All right!  [Exerting himself]  Here's a bell!

VOICE.  [Through the door]  The bleeding's stopped.  Shall I send
him in to you?

LADYELLA.  Oh, please!  Poor darling!

     [They listen.]

     [LADYELLA, prepares to receive EDWARD.  SQUIRE and RECTOR
     stand transfixed.  The door opens, and a bare arm gently pushes
     EDWARD forth.  He is bandaged with a smooth towel.  There is a
     snuffle--HANNIBAL has broken the scarf, outside.]

LADYELLA.  [Aghast]  Look!  Hannibal's loose!  Maud--Tommy.  [To THE
RECTOR]  You!

     [The THREE rush to prevent HANNIBAL from re-entering.]

LADYELLA.  [To EDWARD]  Yes, I know--you'd like to!  You SHALL bite
him when it's safe.  Oh!  my darling, you DO----[She sniffs]

     [MAUD and SQUIRE.re-enter.]

Have you tied him properly this time?

MAUD.  With Bertie's braces.

LADYELLA.  Oh! but----

MAUD.  It's all right; they're almost leather.

     [RECTOR re-enters, with a slight look of insecurity.]

LADYELLA.  Rector, are you sure it's safe?

RECTOR.  [Hitching at his trousers]  No, indeed, LADY Ella--I----

LADYELLA.  Tommy, do lend a hand!

SQUIRE.  All right, Ella; all right!  He doesn't mean what you
mean!

LADYELLA.  [Transferring EDWARD to SQUIRE]  Hold him, Tommy.
He's sure to smell out Hannibal!

SQUIRE.  [Taking EDWARD by the collar, and holding his own nose]
Jove!  Clever if he can smell anything but himself.  Phew!  She ought
to have the Victoria Cross for goin' in that pond.

     [The door opens, and HERSELF appears; a fine, frank, handsome
     woman, in a man's orange-coloured motor-coat, hastily thrown on
     over the substrata of costume.]

SHE.  So very sorry--had to have a bath, and change, of course!

LADYELLA.  We're so awfully grateful to you.  It was splendid.

MAUD.  Quite.

RECTOR.  [Rather holding himself together]  Heroic!  I was just
myself about to----

SQUIRE.  [Restraining EDWARD]  Little beast will fight--must
apologise--you were too quick for me----

     [He looks up at her.  She is smiling, and regarding the wounded
     dog, her head benevolently on one side.]

SHE.  Poor dears!  They thought they were so safe in that nice pond!

LADYELLA.  Is he very badly torn?

SHE.  Rather nasty.  There ought to be a stitch or two put in his
ear.

LADYELLA.  I thought so.  Tommy, do----

SQUIRE.  All right.  Am I to let him go?

LADYELLA.  No.

MAUD.  The fly's outside.  Bertie, run and tell Jarvis to drive in
for the Vet.

RECTOR.  [Gentle and embarrassed]  Run?  Well, Maud--I----

SHE.  The doctor would sew it up.  My maid can go round.

     [HANNIBAL.  appears at the open casement with the broken braces
     dangling from his collar.]

LADYELLA.  Look!  Catch him!  Rector!

MAUD.  Bertie!  Catch him!

     [RECTOR seizes HANNIBAL, but is seen to be in difficulties
     with his garments.  HERSELF, who has gone out left, returns,
     with a leather strop in one hand and a pair of braces in the
     other.]

SHE.  Take this strop--he can't break that.  And would these be any
good to you?

     [SHE hands the braces to MAUD and goes out on to the verandah
     and hastily away.  MAUD, transferring the braces to the RECTOR,
     goes out, draws HANNIBAL from the casement window, and secures
     him with the strap.  RECTOR sits suddenly with the braces in
     his hands.  There is a moment's peace.]

LADYELLA.  Splendid, isn't she?  I do admire her.

SQUIRE.  She's all there.

RECTOR.  [Feelingly]  Most kind.

     [He looks ruefully at the braces and at LADYELLA.  A silence.
     MAUD reappears at the door and stands gazing at the braces.]

SQUIRE.  [Suddenly]  Eh?

MAUD.  Yes.

SQUIRE.  [Looking at his wife]  Ah!

LADYELLA.  [Absorbed in EDWARD]  Poor darling!

SQUIRE.  [Bluntly]  Ella, the Rector wants to get up!

RECTOR.  [Gently]  Perhaps--just for a moment----

LADYELLA.  Oh!  [She turns to the wall.]

     [RECTOR, screened by his WIFE, retires on to the verandah to
     adjust his garments.]

SQUIRE.  [Meditating]  So she's married!

LADYELLA.  [Absorbed in EDWARD]  Why?

SQUIRE.  Braces.

LADYELLA.  Oh!  Yes.  We ought to ask them to dinner, Tommy.

SQUIRE.  Ah!  Yes.  Wonder who they are?

     [RECTOR and MAUD reappear.]

RECTOR.  Really very good of her to lend her husband's--I was--
er--quite----

MAUD.  That'll do, Bertie.

     [THEY see HER returning along the verandah, followed by a sandy,
     red-faced gentleman in leather leggings, with a needle and
     cotton in his hand.]

HERSELF.  Caught the doctor just starting, So lucky!

LADYELLA.  Oh!  Thank goodness!

DOCTOR.  How do, Lady Ella?  How do, Squire?--how do, Rector?  [To
MAUD]  How de do?  This the beastie?  I see.  Quite!  Who'll hold him
for me?

LADYELLA.  Oh!  I!

HERSELF.  D'you know, I think I'd better.  It's so dreadful when it's
your own, isn't it?  Shall we go in here, doctor?  Come along, pretty
boy!

     [She takes EDWARD, and they pass into the room, left.]

LADYELLA.  I dreaded it.  She is splendid!

SQUIRE.  Dogs take to her.  That's a sure sign.

RECTOR.  Little things--one can always tell.

SQUIRE.  Something very attractive about her--what!  Fine build
of woman.

MAUD.  I shall get hold of her for parish work.

RECTOR.  Ah!  Excellent--excellent!  Do!

SQUIRE.  Wonder if her husband shoots?  She seems
quite-er--quite----

LADYELLA.  [Watching the door]  Quite!  Altogether charming; one of
the nicest faces I ever saw.

     [THE DOCTOR comes out alone.]

Oh!  Doctor--have you? is it----?

DOCTOR.  Right as rain!  She held him like an angel--he just licked
her, and never made a sound.

LADYELLA.  Poor darling!  Can I----

     [She signs toward the door.]

DOCTOR.  Better leave 'em a minute.  She's moppin' 'im off.  [He
wrinkles his nose]  Wonderful clever hands!

SQUIRE.  I say--who is she?

DOCTOR.  [Looking from face to face with a dubious and rather
quizzical expression]  Who?  Well--there you have me!  All I know is
she's a first-rate nurse--been helpin' me with a case in Ditch Lane.
Nice woman, too--thorough good sort!  Quite an acquisition here.
H'm!  [Again that quizzical glance]  Excuse me hurryin' off--very
late.  Good-bye, Rector.  Good-bye, Lady Ella.  Good-bye!

     [He goes.  A silence.]

SQUIRE.  H'm!  I suppose we ought to be a bit careful.

     [JARVIS, flyman of the old school, has appeared on the
     verandah.]

JARVIS.  [To RECTOR]  Beg pardon, sir.  Is the little dog all
right?

MAUD.  Yes.

JARVIS.  [Touching his hat]  Seein' you've missed your train, m'm,
shall I wait, and take you 'ome again?

MAUD.  No.

JARVIS.  Cert'nly, m'm.  [He touches his hat with a circular gesture,
and is about to withdraw.]

LADYELLA.  Oh, Jarvis--what's the name of the people here?

JARVIS.  Challenger's the name I've driven 'em in, my lady.

SQUIRE.  Challenger?  Sounds like a hound.  What's he like?

JARVIS.  [Scratching his head]  Wears a soft 'at, sir.

SQUIRE.  H'm!  Ah!

JARVIS.  Very nice gentleman, very nice lady.  'Elped me with my old
mare when she 'ad the 'ighsteria last week--couldn't 'a' been kinder
if they'd 'a' been angels from 'eaven.  Wonderful fond o' dumb
animals, the two of 'em.  I don't pay no attention to gossip, meself.

MAUD.  Gossip?  What gossip?

JARVIS.  [Backing]  Did I make use of the word, m'm?  You'll excuse
me, I'm sure.  There's always talk where there's newcomers.  I takes
people as I finds 'em.


RECTOR.  Yes, yes, Jarvis--quite--quite right!

JARVIS.  Yes, sir.  I've--I've got a 'abit that way at my time o'
life.

MAUD.  [Sharply]  How long have they been here, Jarvis?

JARVIS.  Well---er--a matter of three weeks, m'm.

     [A slight involuntary stir.]

[Apologetic]  Of course, in my profession I can't afford to take
notice of whether there's the trifle of a ring between 'em, as the
sayin' is.  'Tisn't 'ardly my business like.

     [A silence.]

LADYELLA.  [Suddenly]  Er--thank you, Jarvis; you needn't wait.

JARVIS.  No, m'lady.  Your service, sir--service, m'm.

     [He goes.  A silence.]

SQUIRE.  [Drawing a little closer]  Three weeks?  I say--er--
wasn't there a book?

RECTOR.  [Abstracted]  Three weeks----I certainly haven't seen
them in church.

MAUD.  A trifle of a ring!

LADYELLA.  [Impulsively]  Oh, bother!  I'm sure she's all right.
And if she isn't, I don't care.  She's been much too splendid.

SQUIRE.  Must think of the village.  Didn't quite like the
doctor's way of puttin' us off.

LADYELLA.  The poor darling owes his life to her.

SQUIRE.  H'm!  Dash it!  Yes!  Can't forget the way she ran into
that stinkin' pond.

MAUD.  Had she a wedding-ring on?

     [They look at each other, but no one knows.]

LADYELLA.  Well, I'm not going to be ungrateful.

SQUIRE.  It'd be dashed awkward--mustn't take a false step, Ella.

RECTOR.  And I've got his braces!  [He puts his hand to his
waist.]

MAUD.  [Warningly]  Bertie!

SQUIRE.  That's all right, Rector--we're goin' to be perfectly
polite, and--and--thank her, and all that.

LADYELLA.  We can see she's a good sort.  What does it matter?

MAUD.  My dear Ella!  "What does it matter!"  We've got to know.

RECTOR.  We do want light.

SQUIRE.  I'll ring the bell.  [He rings.]

     [They look at each other aghast.]

LADYELLA.  What did you ring for, Tommy?

SQUIRE.  [Flabbergasted]  God knows!

MAUD.  Somebody'll come.

SQUIRE.  Rector--you--you've got to----

MAUD.  Yes, Bertie.

RECTOR.  Dear me!  But--er--what--er----How?

SQUIRE.  [Deeply-to himself]  The whole thing's damn delicate.

     [The door right is opened and a MAID appears.  She is a
     determined-looking female.  They face her in silence.]

RECTOR.  Er--er----your master is not in?

MAID.  No.  'E's gone up to London.

RECTOR.  Er----Mr Challenger, I think?

MAID.  Yes.

RECTOR.  Yes!  Er----quite so

MAID.  [Eyeing them]  D'you want--Mrs Challenger?

RECTOR.  Ah! Not precisely----

SQUIRE.  [To him in a low, determined voice]  Go on.

RECTOR.  [Desperately]  I asked because there was a--a--Mr.
Challenger I used to know in the 'nineties, and I thought--you
wouldn't happen to know how long they've been married?  My friend
marr----

MAID.  Three weeks.

RECTOR.  Quite so--quite so!  I shall hope it will turn out to
be----Er--thank you--Ha!

LADYELLA.  Our dog has been fighting with the Rector's, and Mrs
Challenger rescued him;  she's bathing his ear.  We're waiting to
thank her.  You needn't----

MAID.  [Eyeing them]  No.

     [She turns and goes out.]

SQUIRE.  Phew!  What a gorgon!  I say, Rector, did you really
know a Challenger in the 'nineties?

RECTOR.  [Wiping his brow]  No.

SQUIRE.  Ha!  Jolly good!

LADYELLA.  Well, you see!--it's all right.

RECTOR.  Yes, indeed.  A great relief!

LADYELLA.  [Moving to the door]  I must go in now.

SQUIRE.  Hold on!  You goin' to ask 'em to--to--anything?

LADYELLA.  Yes.

MAUD.  I shouldn't.

LADYELLA.  Why not?  We all like the look of her.

RECTOR.  I think we should punish ourselves for entertaining that
uncharitable thought.

LADYELLA.  Yes.  It's horrible not having the courage to take people
as they are.

SQUIRE.  As they are?  H'm!  How can you till you know?

LADYELLA.  Trust our instincts, of course.

SQUIRE.  And supposing she'd turned out not married--eh!

LADYELLA!  She'd still be herself, wouldn't she?

MAUD.  Ella!

SQUIRE.  H'm!  Don't know about that.

LADYELLA.  Of course she would, Tommy.

RECTOR.  [His hand stealing to his waist]  Well!  It's a great
weight off my----!

LADYELLA.  There's the poor darling snuffling.  I must go in.

     [She knocks on the door.  It is opened, and EDWARD comes out
     briskly, with a neat little white pointed ear-cap on one ear.]

LADYELLA.  Precious!

     [SHE HERSELF Comes out, now properly dressed in flax-blue
     linen.]

LADYELLA.  How perfectly sweet of you to make him that!

SHE.  He's such a dear.  And the other poor dog?

MAUD.  Quite safe, thanks to your strop.

     [HANNIBAL appears at the window, with the broken strop dangling.
     Following her gaze, they turn and see him.]

MAUD.  Oh!  There, he's broken it.  Bertie!

SHE.  Let me!  [She seizes HANNIBAL.]

SQUIRE.  We're really most tremendously obliged to you.  Afraid
we've been an awful nuisance.

SHE.  Not a bit.  I love dogs.

SQUIRE.  Hope to make the acquaintance of Mr----of your husband.

LADYELLA.  [To EDWARD, who is straining]

     [Gently, darling!  Tommy, take him.]

     [SQUIRE.does so.]

MAUD.  [Approaching HANNIBAL.]  Is he behaving?

     [She stops short, and her face suddenly shoots forward at HER
     hands that are holding HANNIBAL'S neck.]

SHE.  Oh!  yes--he's a love.

MAUD.  [Regaining her upright position, and pursing her lips; in a
peculiar voice]  Bertie, take Hannibal.

RECTOR.takes him.

LADYELLA.  [Producing a card]  I can't be too grateful for all
you've done for my poor darling.  This is where we live.  Do come--
and see----

     [MAUD, whose eyes have never left those hands, tweaks LADY
     ELLA's dress.]

LADYELLA.  That is--I'm--I----

     [HERSELF looks at LADYELLA.in surprise.]

SQUIRE.  I don't know if your husband shoots, but if----

     [MAUD, catching his eye, taps the third finger of her left
     hand.]

--er--he--does--er--er----

     [HERSELF looks at SQUIRE.surprised.]

MAUD.  [Turning to her husband, repeats the gesture with the low and
simple word]  Look!

RECTOR.  [With round eyes, severely]  Hannibal!  [He lifts him
bodily and carries him away.]

MAUD.  Don't squeeze him, Bertie!

     [She follows through the French window.]

SQUIRE.  [Abruptly--of the unoffending EDWARD]  That dog'll be
forgettin' himself in a minute.

     [He picks up EDWARD and takes him out.]

     [LADYELLA.is left staring.]

LADYELLA.  [At last]  You mustn't think, I----You mustn't think, we
----Oh!  I must just see they--don't let Edward get at Hannibal.

     [She skims away.]

     [HERSELF is left staring after LADYELLA, in surprise.]

SHE.  What is the matter with them?

     [The door is opened.]

MAID.  [Entering and holding out a wedding-ring--severely]  You
left this, m'm, in the bathroom.

SHE.  [Looking, startled, at her finger]  Oh! [Taking it]  I hadn't
missed it.  Thank you, Martha.

     [MAID goes.]

     [A hand, slipping in at the casement window, softly lays a pair
     of braces on the windowsill.  SHE looks at the braces, then at
     the ring.  HER lip curls.]

Sue.  [Murmuring deeply]  Ah!
